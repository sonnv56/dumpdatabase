But sometimes, as a kind of prediction properties can also be found by calculations in a mathematical manner, without performing simulations. Examples of properties that can be explored in such a manner are:whether some values for the variables exist for which no change occurs (stationary points or equilibria), and how such values may depend on the values of the parameters of the model and/or the initial values for the variableswhether certain variables in the model converge to some limit value (equilibria) and how this may depend on the values of the parameters of the model and/or the initial values for the variableswhether or not certain variables will show monotonically increasing or decreasing values over time (monotonicity)how fast a convergence to a limit value takes place (convergence speed)whether situations occur in which no convergence takes place but in the end a specific sequence of values is repeated all the time (limit cycle) Such properties found in an analytic mathematical manner can be used for verification of the model by checking them for the values observed in simulation experiments. If one of these properties is not fulfilled, then there will be some error in the implementation of the model. In this paper some methods to analyse such properties of dynamical models will be described and illustrated for the Hebbian learning model, and for dynamic connection strengths in social networks. The properties analysed by the methods discussed cover equilibria, increasing or decreasing trends, recurring patterns (limit cycles), and speed of convergence to equilibria.</td><td>&nbsp;</td><td>[1] Bendixson, I.: Sur les courbes déﬁnies par des équations différentielles.

A mixture of optimal hyperspheres is automatically discovered to characterize data. The model includes two parts: log likelihood to control the fit of data to model (i.e., empirical risk) and regularization quantizer to control the generalization ability of model (i.e., general risk). Expectation maximization (EM) principle is employed to train our proposed mSVDD. We demonstrate the advantage of the proposed model: if learning mSVDD in the input space, it simulates learning a single hypersphere in the feature space and the accuracy is thus comparable, but the training time is significantly shorter.</td><td>Mixture of experts;Mixture model;Kernel method;One-class classification </td><td>[1] 1.

In fact, in most cases, the real datasets lead to a very large number of rules, which do not allow users to make their own selection of the most relevant. The difficult task is mining useful and non-redundant rules. Several approaches have been proposed, such as rule clustering, informative cover method and quality measurements. Another way to selecting relevant association rules, we believe that it is necessary to integrate a decisional approach within the knowledge discovery process. Therefore, in this paper, we propose an approach to discover a category of relevant association rules based on multi-criteria analysis. In other side, the general process of association rules extraction becomes more and more complex, to solve such problem, we also proposed a multi-agent system for modeling the different process of our proposed approach. Therefore, we conclude our work by an empirical study applied to a set of banking data to illustrate the performance of our approach.</td><td>Data mining;Association rules;Multi-criteria analysis;Multi-agent system </td><td>[1] Frawley, W., Piatetsky-Shapiro, G., Matheus, C.: Knowledge discovery in databases an overview.

Although there have been many studies on the classification of speech, the results are still limited. Firstly, most of the speech classification approaches requiring input data have the same dimension. Secondly, all traditional methods must be trained before classifying speech signal and must be retrained when having more training data or new class. In this paper, we propose an approach for speech classification using Scale-invariant Feature Transform (SIFT) features on spectrogram images of speech signal combination with Local naïve Bayes nearest neighbor. The proposed approach allows using feature vectors to have different sizes. With this approach, the achieved classification results are satisfactory. They are 73, 96, 95, 97 %, and 97 % on the ISOLET, English Isolated Digits, Vietnamese Places, Vietnamese Digits, JVPD databases, respectively. Especially, in a subset of the TMW database, the accuracy is 100 %. In addition, in our proposed approach, non-retraining is needed for additional training data after the training phase. The experiment shows that the more features are added to the model, the more is the accuracy in performance.</td><td>LNBNN;SIFT;Speech perception;Speech classification </td><td>[1] Liberman, A.M., Cooper, F.S., Shankweiler, D.P., StuddertKennedy, M.: Perception of speech code.

There have been many researches proposing different models of routing protocols and numerous simulations to enhance their performances under varying conditions and constraints. However, most of them only focus on network layer without considering the influence of media access control (MAC) layer. In this paper, a new strategy of cross layer algorithm is proposed based on the characteristics of reactive routing and multi-hop jumping. In addition, artificial bee colony algorithm is performed to calculate the contention window of the nodes along the routing path over MAC layer. This framework could avoid data collision in MAC layer, and results in getting better performances of data transmission in network layer. Extensive simulations show that the proposed AODV with intelligent priority flow scheme is able to earn a significant improvement over the conventional routing algorithm.</td><td>AODV protocol;Contention window;Artificial bee colony algorithm (ABCA);Mobile ad hoc network (MANET) </td><td>[1] Amirhosein, I., Alireza, K.H.: DSDV-Het; a new scalable routing protocol for large heterogeneous ad Hoc networks.

Accordingly, we assume that MCC is likely to be of the heart of healthcare transformation. MCC offers new kinds of services and facilities for patients and caregivers. In this regard, we have tried to propose a new mobile medical web service system. To this end, we implement a medical cloud multi-agent system (MCMAS) solution for polyclinic ESSALEMA Sfax—TUNISIA, using Google’s Android operating system. The developed system has been assessing using the CloudSim Simulator. This paper presents initial results of the system in practice. In fact the proposed solution shows that the MCMAS has a commanding capability to cope with the problem of traditional application. The performance of the MCMAS is compared with the traditional system in polyclinic ESSALEMA which showed that this prototype yields better recital than using usual application.</td><td>Mobile cloud computing;Healthcare;Mobile web services;Cloud computing;CloudSim;Medical cloud multi-agent system </td><td>[1] Sharma, A.K., Soni, P.: Mobile cloud computing (MCC): open research issues.

They are effectively changing the way data are distributed and managed on the Internet. To get a better understanding of the emergence of data marketplaces, we have conducted several surveys in recent years to systematically gather and evaluate their characteristics. This paper takes a broader perspective and relates data marketplaces as currently discussed in computer science to the neoclassical notions of market and marketplace from economics. Specifically, we provide a typology of electronic marketplaces and discuss their approaches to the distribution of data. Finally, we provide a distinct definition of data marketplaces, leading to a classification framework that can provide structure for the emerging field of data marketplace research.</td><td>Data-as-a-Service;Data marketplace;Data marketplace survey;Data marketplace development;Classification;Economics;Computer Science </td><td>[1] Alt, R., Caesar, M.A., Grau, J.: Collaboration in the consumer products goods industry—analysis of marketplaces.

The underlying common assumption of many existing models is that the operating environment and the developing environment are the same. This is often not the case in practice because the operating environments are usually unknown due to the uncertainty of environments in the field. In this paper, we develop a generalized software reliability model incorporating the uncertainty of fault-detection rate per unit of time in the operating environments. A logistic fault-detection software reliability model is derived. Examples are included to illustrate the goodness of fit of the proposed model and existing nonhomogeneous Poisson process (NHPP) models based on a set of failure data. Three goodness-of-fit criteria, such as mean square error, predictive power, and predictive ratio risk are used as an example to illustrate model comparisons. The results show that the proposed logistic fault-detection model fit significantly better than other existing NHPP models based on all three goodness-of-fit criteria.</td><td>Non-homogeneous Poisson process;Software reliability growth model;Mean square error;Predictive ratio risk;Predictive power;Logistic fault-detection rate </td><td>[1] Goel, A.L., Okumoto, K.: Time-dependent fault-detection rate model for software and other performance measures.

The MAM algorithm (with a targeted assortative index value of 1) works on the basis of the assortative weight of an edge, defined as the product of the number of uncovered adjacent edges and the absolute difference of the weights of the end vertices of the edge. The MAM algorithm prefers to include the edge with the smallest assortativity weight (the assortative weight of the edges is updated for each iteration) until all the edges in the graph are covered. We show that the MAM algorithm can be easily adapted to be used for maximal dissortative matching (MDM) with a targeted assortative index of \(-\)1 for the matching as well as for maximal node matching (MNM) algorithm to maximize the percentage of nodes matched. We illustrate the execution of the MAM, MDM and MNM algorithms on complex network graphs such as the random network graphs and scale-free network graphs as well as on real-world network graphs and analyze the tradeoffs.</td><td>Maximal matching;Assortative matching;Dissortative matching;Assortativity index;Complex networks ;Independent edge set;Node similarity;Random networks ;Scale-free networks </td><td>[1] Edmonds, J.: Paths, trees, and ﬂowers.

In the similarity search, data normalization is a must to obtain accurate results. However, data normalization on the fly and the DTW calculation cost a great deal of computational time and memory space. In the paper, we present two methods, SUCR-DTW and ESUCR-DTW, which conduct similarity search for numerous prespecified patterns over multiple time-series streams under DTW supporting data normalization. These two methods utilize a combination of techniques to mitigate the aforementioned costs. The efficient methods inherit the cascading lower bounds introduced in UCR-DTW, a state-of-the-art method of similarity search in the static time series, to admissibly prune off unpromising subsequences. To be adaptive in the streaming setting, SUCR-DTW performs incremental updates on the envelopes of new-coming time-series subsequences and incremental data normalization on time-series data. However, like UCR-DTW, SUCR-DTW retrieves only similar subsequences that have the same length as the patterns. ESUCR-DTW, an extension of SUCR-DTW, can find similar subsequences whose lengths are different from those of the patterns. Furthermore, our proposed methods exploit multi-threading to have a fast response to high-speed time-series streams. The experimental results show that SUCR-DTW obtains the same precision as UCR-DTW and has lower wall clock time. Besides, the experimental results of SUCR-DTW and ESUCR-DTW reveal that the extended method has higher accuracy in spite of longer wall clock time. Also, the paper evaluates the influence of incremental z-score normalization and incremental min–max normalization on the obtained results.</td><td>Similarity search;Time series stream;Dynamic time warping;Data normalization </td><td>[1] Borgne, Y.-A., Santinib, S., Bontempi, G.: Adaptive model selection for time series prediction in wireless sensor networks.

In which, prediction of novel disease-associated genes is mostly focused. Many methods have been proposed based on biological networks and shown effectively for the problem. These network-based methods are usually relied on a “disease module” principle that functionally similar genes are associated with similar phenotypes or diseases. Among them, methods solely based on gene/protein networks only exploit that principle by structural modules in the gene/protein networks. Meanwhile, others based on integration of these networks with a disease similarity network better exploit the principle and consequently result in higher prediction performance. In these studies, the disease similarity network is extracted from a disease similarity matrix which was calculated using text mining techniques on OMIM records. Considering that diseases have been recently well annotated by human phenotype ontology (i.e., a controlled vocabulary database) and semantic similarity measures can be used to calculate similarities among them. Therefore, it would be more accurate to construct disease similarity network based on semantic similarity measures on phenotype ontology database. In this study, we constructed such network and integrated them with several kinds of gene/protein networks. Experiment results show that the ontology-based disease similarity network much improves the prediction performance compared to the one based on OMIM records, irrespective of gene/protein networks.

However, it is often not true due to various factors including software complexity, programmer proficiency, organization hierarchy, etc. In this paper, we develop a software reliability model with considerations of fault-dependent detection, imperfect fault removal and the maximum number of faults software. The genetic algorithm (GA) method is applied to estimate the model parameters. Four goodness-of-fit criteria, such as mean-squared error, predictive-ratio risk, predictive power, and Akaike information criterion, are used to compare the proposed model and several existing software reliability models. Three datasets collected in industries are used to demonstrate the better fit of the proposed model than other existing software reliability models based on the studied criteria.</td><td>Non-homogeneous Poisson process (NHPP);Software reliability growth;Fault-dependent detection;Imperfect fault removal;The maximum number of software faults </td><td>[1] Pham, H.: Software reliability and cost models: perspectives, comparison, and practice.

Dealing with the factors, El Niño–Southern Oscillation, and other global factors such as Quasi-Biennial Oscillation, Pacific Decanal Oscillation, etc. and local factors such as sea surface temperature, sea level pressures, etc. were examined for tropical cyclone forecasting. For regression, the most previous works used the linear regression-based model for seasonal tropical forecasting. However, the seasonal tropical forecasting requires high-dimensional data, so the forecasting ability using linear regression will have drawback. In this work, we analyse literatures of forecasting factors and regression methods for tropical cyclone forecasting. A CF-ANFIS algorithm integrating a conjunct space cluster and Cascade-forward neural network are proposed to forecast the number of tropical cyclone making landfall. This algorithm resolves the drawback by considering all forecast factors with high-dimensional data. The experimental results indicated that the CF-ANFIS for seasonal forecast of tropical cyclones is a significantly effective approach with high accuracy in comparison with traditional ANFIS.</td><td>ANFIS;Machine learning;Forecasting;ENSO;El Niño;Tropical cyclone making landfall </td><td>[1] Azizi, A., Ali, Y.A., Ping, L.W.: Model development and comparative study of Bayesian and ANFIS inferences for uncertain variables of production line in tile industry.

One kind of such knowledge that enables us to get insights into our students’ characteristics is cluster models generated by a clustering task. Each cluster model presents the groups of similar students by several aspects such as study performance, behavior, skill, etc. Many recent educational data clustering works used the existing algorithms like k-means, expectation–maximization, spectral clustering, etc. Nevertheless, none of them considered the incompleteness of the educational data gathered in an academic credit system although incomplete data handling was figured out well with several different general-purpose solutions. Unfortunately, early in-trouble student detection normally faces data incompleteness as we have collected and processed the study results of the second-, third-, and fourth-year students who have not yet accomplished the program as of that moment. In this situation, the clustering task becomes an inevitable incomplete educational data clustering task. Hence, our work focuses on an incomplete educational data clustering approach to the aforementioned task. Following kernel-based vector quantization, we define a robust effective simple solution, named VQ_fk_nps, which is able to not only handle ubiquitous data incompleteness in an iterative manner using the nearest prototype strategy but also optimize the clusters in the feature space to reach the resulting clusters with arbitrary shapes in the data space. As shown through the experimental results on real educational data sets, the clusters from our solution have better cluster quality as compared to some existing approaches.</td><td>Incomplete data clustering;Educational data mining ;Kernel-based vector quantization;Nearest prototype strategy;Non-spherical cluster </td><td>[1] AbdAllah, L., Shimshoni, I.: Mean shift clustering algorithm for data with missing values.

The ant colony optimization (ACO) approach offers reasonably good quality solutions for the TSP, but it suffers from its inherent non-determinism and as a consequence the processing time is unpredictable. The paper tries to mitigate the problem by a substantial increase in the number of used ants. This approach is called ant hyper population and it could be obtained by increasing the number of ants in a single colony assigning more than one colony to solve the same task or both. In all cases the level of non-determinism decreases and thus the number iterations could be reduced. Parallel implementation of the ACO makes it possible to reduce drastically the processing time. The paper compares two ways of implementation of the parallelism using the sockets or the RMI—remote method invocation mechanisms. The paper concentrates on the classical static version of the TSP, but preliminary experiments indicate that such an approach could be even more useful for dynamic TPSs.</td><td>Ant colony optimization;Traveling salesmen problem;Parallelization strategies for ACO;Ant colony community (ACC) </td><td>[1] Antosiewicz, M., Koloch, G., Kaminski, B.: Choice of best possible metaheuristic algorithm for the travelling salesman problem with limited computational time: quality, uncertainty and speed.

In the worst case, the cardinality of the class of all frequent itemsets is of exponent which leads to many difficulties for users. Therefore, a model of constraint-based mining is necessary when their needs and interests are the top priority. This paper aims to find a structure of frequent itemsets that satisfy the following conditions: they include a subset \(C_{10}\), contain no items of a subset \(C^{\prime }_{11} \), and have at least an item belonging to subset \(C^{\prime }_{21}\). The first new point of the paper is the proposed theoretical result that is the generalization of our former researches (Hai et al. in Adv Comput Methods Knowl Eng Sci 479:367–378, 2013). Second, based on new sufficient and necessary conditions discovered just for closed itemsets and their generators in association with the methods of creating borders and eliminating branches and nodes on the lattice, we can effectively and quickly eliminate not only a class of frequent itemsets but also one or more branches of equivalence classes of which elements are insatiate the constraints. Third, a structure and a unique representation of frequent itemsets with extended double constraints are shown by representative closed itemsets and their generators. Finally, all theoretical results in this paper are proven to be reliable and they are firm bases to guarantee the correctness and efficiency of a new algorithm, MFS-EDC, which is used to effectively mine all constrained frequent itemsets. Experiments show the outstanding efficiency of this new algorithm compared to modified post-processing algorithms on benchmark datasets.</td><td>Frequent itemset;Closed frequent itemset;Closed itemsets lattice;Generator;Double constraint;Extended double constraint;Constraint mining </td><td>[1] Agrawal, R., Imielinski, T., Swami, N: Mining association rules between sets of items in large databases.

However, such LMS typically use a “one size fits all” approach without considering individual learner’s profile. A learner’s profile can, for example, consists of his/her learning styles, goals, prior knowledge, abilities, and interests. Generally, LMSs do not cater individual learners’ needs based on their profile. However, considering learners’ profiles can help in enhancing the learning experiences and performance of learners within the course. To support personalization in LMS, recommender systems can be used to recommend appropriate learning objects to learners to increase their learning. In this paper, we introduce the personalized learning object recommender system. The proposed system supports learners by providing them recommendations about which learning objects within the course are more useful for them, considering the learning object they are visiting as well as the learning objects visited by other learners with similar profiles. This kind of personalization can help in improving the overall quality of learning by providing recommendations of learning objects that are useful but were overlooked or intentionally skipped by learners. Such recommendations can increase learners’ performance and satisfaction during the course.</td><td>Personalization;E-learning;Learning management systems;Recommender system;Association rule mining;Learning objects </td><td>[1] Eke, H.N.: Modeling LIS students’ intention to adopt e-learning:n a case from University of Nigeria, Nsukka.

This calculus is equipped with a labeled transition system semantics and also with an unsafe P/T Petri net semantics, which is sound w.r.t. the transition system semantics. For any process p of the calculus, the net associated to p by the semantics has always a finite number of places, but it has a finite number of transitions only for so-called well-formed processes. The main result of the paper is that well-formed finite-net multi-CCS processes are able to represent all finite, statically reduced, P/T Petri nets.</td><td>Operational semantics;Process algebra;Petri nets </td><td>[1] Aranda, J., Valencia, F., Versari, C.: On the expressive power of restriction and priorities in CCS with replication.

The central of this phase is an algorithm for computing verbal relationships in the process of generating the Vietnamese paragraph from the logical expression of discourse representation structure (DRS), which is the first-order logic expressions without explicit quantifiers, and represents the meaning as well as reflects the potential contexts of a given discourse or a sequence of sentences. By defining elements to describe the appropriate information in each predicate of the logical expression (or can be called “DRS-conditions”), the algorithm is based on in turn considering three consecutive predicates in a logical expression for determining: the relationship between the first and second sentence, the relationship between the second and third sentence, and the priority when comparing these two relationships. The evaluation achieves two given criteria: the semantic completeness of summarization, and the natural quality of new reduced paragraph.</td><td>Logical expression;Discourse representation structure ;Sentence generation;Predicate relationship </td><td>[1] Blackburn, P., Bos, J.: Representation and Inference for Natural Language—Volume II: Working with Discourse Representation Structures.

Thus, RSS feeds appear as monitoring tool of current events according to users preferences. However, the user is flooded by the amount of such RSS feeds. For that reason, any analysis of RSS feeds seems effortful and complex. In this paper, we aim to improve the effectiveness and swiftness of pertinent RSS feeds analysis through recommending suitable fragments of queries during the analysis process of events. Accordingly, we propose an innovative architecture of our new active RSS feeds warehouse. Additionally, we introduce a new recommender system to improve the querying expression of RSS feeds.

In general, cloud infrastructure providers offer a wide range of services with different pricing models, instance types and a host of value-added features. Efficient selection of cloud services constitutes significant management challenges for cloud consumer, which is tedious and involves large information processing. To overcome this, the cloud brokers provide resource provisioning options that ease the task of choosing the best services based on consumers requirements and also provide a uniform management interface to access cloud services. This paper proposes a novel cloud brokering architecture that provides an optimal deployment plan for placement of virtual resources in multiple clouds. The objective of the deployment plan is to select the best cloud services with optimal cost, taking into account various attributes defined in service measurement index (SMI) with additional physical and logical constraints. The proposed cloud brokering architecture has been modeled using mixed integer programming formulation and Benders decomposition algorithm to solve efficiently. Efficacy of the proposed algorithm has been verified by extensive numerical studies and sensitivity analysis.</td><td>Cloud broker;Infrastructure as a service;Deployment plan;Service measurement index;Mixed integer programming;Optimization </td><td>[1] Buyya, R., Yeo, C.S., Venugopal, S., Broberg, J., Brandic, I.: Cloud computing and emerging IT platforms: vision, hype, and reality for delivering computing as the 5th utility.

Discovering the patterns in workload information, such as audit trails, traces of user applications, and sequences of dynamic performance views, is a complex and time-consuming task. This work investigates a new approach to analysis of information included in the database audit trails. In particular, it describes the transformations of information included in the audit trails into a format that can be used for discovering the periodic patterns in the fluctuations of database workloads. It presents an algorithm that finds elementary periodic patterns through nested iterations over a four-dimensional space of execution plans of SQL statements and positional parameters of the patterns. It proposes a collection of composition rules for the derivations of complex periodic patterns from the elementary and other complex patterns and it shows how to use such rules to predict the future workload levels.</td><td>Periodic pattern;Audit trail;Automated performance tuning ;Online database design </td><td>[1] Abadi, M., Manna, Z.: Temporal logic programming.

This paper proposes an algorithm for cooperative policy construction for independent learners, named Q-learning with aggregation (QA-learning). The algorithm is based on a distributed hierarchical learning model and utilises three specialisations of agents: workers, tutors and consultants. The consultant agent incorporates the entire system in its problem space, which it decomposes into sub-problems that are assigned to the tutor and worker agents. The QA-learning algorithm aggregates the Q-tables of worker agents into a central repository managed by their tutor agent. Each tutor’s Q-table is then incorporated into the consultant’s Q-table, resulting in a Q-table for the entire problem. The algorithm was tested using a distributed hunter prey problem, and experimental results show that QA-learning converges to a solution faster than single agent Q-learning and some famous cooperative Q-learning algorithms.</td><td>Reinforcement learning;Q-Learning;Multi-agent system;Distributed system;Markov decision process;Factored Markov decision process </td><td>[1] Abbeel, P., Ng, A.: Exploration and apprenticeship learning in reinforcement learning.

The rapidly evolving technology on the database field provides the opportunity to manage directly the semi-structured documents in line with the requirements of business processes. A continuum of possible document formats may exist in business environments. The documents can be categorized by the organization of the underlying data collections and according to the necessity and capability of data included in documents as whether wholly or partially is to be structured. The most modern database technology yields tools for handling and retrieving data making use of semi-structured and unstructured data. Our proposed approach (1) on one hand provides a theoretical framework for modeling IS to shape into some structure, (2) on the other hand yields guidance for design method to employ it for practical application with the extension of specific elementary models. The proposed modeling method that places the emphasis onto the documents and their symbiotic life with processes helps in understanding the behavior of most modern information systems. As a result, the combination of document-centric modeling and the enterprise architecture approach gives an opportunity for a unified modeling approach that keeps an eye on Conway’s thesis that states that software architecture congruent with the structure of development team, and this statement may be paraphrased that the overall document structure may reflect the structure of the specific organization.</td><td>Information;System;Web information system;Document-centric process and data modeling;Process algebra;Information system architecture web services;Service-oriented architectures;Zachman framework </td><td>[1] Allamaraju, S.: RESTful Web Services Cookbook.

The present study includes recognition of handwritten digits using hybrid feature extraction technique including static and dynamic properties of handwritten digit images. In this paper, static properties include number of non-zero (white) pixels in square, horizontal, vertical and diagonal styles as sub regions of a binary image. The dynamic properties include features from recovery of drawing order of original image. The extraction of dynamic features include two stages: first stage recover the drawing order of an image and second stage compute the chain code directions from recovered drawing order. The algorithm for recovery of drawing order uses properties of writing behavior. The support vector machine has been used as recognition method for the proposed feature extraction scheme. We have achieved an overall error rate of 0.73 % for mnist data set including 60,000 training images and 10,000 test images. Our feature extraction technique results in feature vector length of an image equals to 356. The achieved results strengthen our proposed technique usability as error rate achieved is at par with literature (</td><td>Offline and online handwriting ;Recovery of drawing order ;Chain codes ;Support vector machine </td><td>[1] Burges, C.J.C.: A tutorial on support vector machines for pattern recognition.

Many malware targeting iPhone has already emerged and then the situation is getting worse. Accessing e-mails on the internet is not a new capability for iPhone. Other smart phones on the market also provide this capability. The spam e-mails have become a serious problem for iPhone. A novel algorithm, artificial bee-based decision tree (ABBDT) approach, is applied to filter spam e-mails for iPhone in this paper. In the proposed ABBDT approach, decision tree is used to filter spam e-mails for iPhone. In addition, artificial bee algorithm is used to increase the testing accuracy of decision tree. There are total 504 collected e-mails in iPhone dataset and they are categorized into 12 attributes. Another spambase dataset, obtained from UCI repository of machine learning databases, is also used to evaluate the performance of the proposed ABBDT approach. From simulation results, the proposed ABBDT approach outperforms other existing algorithms.</td><td>Spam e-mails;iPhone;Decision tree;Artificial bee;Artificial bee-based decision tree (ABBDT) </td><td>[1] Gilbert, P., Chun, B.G., Cox, L., Jung, J.: Automating privacy testing of smartphone applications.

This work studies concept learning in such information systems. It extends the bisimulation-based concept learning method of Nguyen and Szałas (Rough sets and intelligent systems. Springer, Berlin, pp 517–543, 2013). We take attributes as basic elements of the language. Each attribute may be discrete or numeric. A Boolean attribute is treated as a concept name. This approach is more general and suitable for practical information systems based on description logic than the one of Nguyen and Szałas (Rough sets and intelligent systems. Springer, Berlin, pp 517–543, 2013). As further extensions, we also allow data roles and the concept constructors “functionality” and “unqualified number restrictions”. We formulate and prove an important theorem on basic selectors. We also present a domain partitioning method based on information gain that has been used for our implementation of the method. Apart from basic selectors and simple selectors, we introduce a new kind of selectors, called extended selectors. The evaluation results show that our concept learning method is valuable and extended selectors support it significantly.</td><td>Concept learning;Description logic;Bisimulation </td><td>[1] Abiteboul, S., Hull, R., Vianu, V.: Foundations of Databases.

Several approaches have been proposed in this domain to ensure the satisfaction of decision makers needs and the accuracy of the generated schemas. This paper presents an approach for the validation of multidimensional star schema assisted by repair solutions. Our approach aims to assist designers by detecting constraint violations and proposing repair solutions based on a number of error-based rules formalized in Prolog. Its efficiency stems from using both linguistic similarity computation and a set of heuristics developed by bottom-up design methods to produce warnings about semantic constraint violations and their impact on the quality of the analysis results.</td><td>Multidimensional model;Star schema;Data warehousing;Design;Linguistic similarity </td><td>[1] Abdelhédi, F., Ravat, F., Teste, O., Zurﬂuh, G.: Selfstar: un système interactif pour la construction de schémas multidimensionnels.

Most of current models are based on the experience of transactions in the past with a given partner or on reputation of a partner from other agents in the system. However, these models could not deal with the case, a new coming agent has no experience with partners or could not obtain the information about the reputation of partners. Then, agents in the system and the new one may encounter an obstacle in estimating trust on corresponding partners. In this paper, we introduce a novel mechanism for computing trust of a new coming partner by means of some similarity in a profile of the new agent and the ones of well- known agents. Experiments have been conducted to evaluate the proposed model in the scenario of an e-commerce environment. Our experimental results indicate that the combination model with similarity trust significantly improves computational results, in some particular situation, compared with some recent trust models.</td><td>Trust;Reputation;Trust similarity;Multi-agents system </td><td>[1] Abdul-Rahman, A., Hailes, S.: Supporting trust in virtual communities.

Nevertheless, he/she should be provided with tools enabling both intuitive and effective exploration of RDF-compliant knowledge bases. Natural language querying is one of the solutions that have been proposed so far as means for making knowledge bases more user-friendly. However, the results of natural language querying usually have lower precision and recall than analogical results of graph-based querying. In the paper, we introduce an evaluation methodology based on the 2011 QALD workshop queries that allows to measure the accuracy of a semantic search system as well as the complexity of the query formulation process. The obtained results confirm the intuition that graph-based querying, although assuring comparatively high accuracy of the results, is usually still too difficult for regular users. On the other hand, on the basis of results obtained for an experimental search system referred to as Semantic Focused Crawler, we claim that enhancing a SPARQL-compliant graph-based system by an entity-type recommendation feature may reduce the number of query elements necessary to formulate a query without compromising the quality of the results.</td><td>Semantic Web;Search;RDF ;SPARQL;DBpedia </td><td>[1] Berners-Lee, T., Hendler, J., Lassila, O.: The semantic web.

With the aim of satisfying the needs of users and improving the efficiency and effectiveness of mining task, many various constraints and mining algorithms have been proposed. In practice, finding rules regarding specific itemsets is of interest. Thus, this paper considers the problem of mining association rules whose left-hand and right-hand sides contain two given itemsets, respectively. In addition, they also have to satisfy two given maximum support and confidence constraints. Applying previous algorithms to solve this problem may encounter disadvantages, such as the generation of many redundant candidates, time-consuming constraint check and the repeated reading of the database when the constraints are changed. The paper proposes an equivalence relation using the closure of itemset to partition the solution set into disjoint equivalence classes and a new, efficient representation of the rules in each class based on the lattice of closed itemsets and their generators. The paper also develops a new algorithm, called MAR-MINSC, to rapidly mine all constrained rules from the lattice instead of mining them directly from the database. Theoretical results are proven to be reliable. Because MAR-MINSC does not meet drawbacks above, in extensive experiments on many databases it obtains the outstanding performance in comparison with some of existing algorithms in mining association rules with the constraints mentioned.</td><td>Frequent itemsets;Closed frequent itemsets;Closed itemset lattice;Generators;Association rules;Association rules with constraints;Constraint mining;Equivalence relation;Partition </td><td>[1] Agrawal, R., Mannila, H., Srikant, R., Toivonen, H., Verkamo, A.I.: Fast discovery of association rules.

The tag selection process focuses on the selection of appropriate ontological tag—tag defined in the ontology, for the article. The ontology weight computing is proposed for tag suggestion. A technique for ontology building using blog articles is also presented as well as an extensive experiment.

These systems should respond to the unexpected changes during the travel. As a result, the first step is to sense the traveler’s specifications, needs, and preferences before, during, and after the travel. Moreover, they should gather information about the accommodations, flights, cities, activities, and destinations through the different sources. In the next stage, these systems should provide personalized information. However, current tourist systems are not able to collect all travelers and travel products information from different resources. In addition, they failed to provide a sequence of recommendation on the different travel products (i.e., main destination, desired budget, length of travel, accommodation, transportation, activity, and restaurant) based on the traveler order preferences and travel stage. These systems do not support any customization. For instance, expert traveler or system admin could not change the recommendation algorithm settings anymore. To address these problems and issues, we propose and implement an adaptive tourist recommendation system that is supported by an adaptive tourist recommendation framework, process, architecture, and system.</td><td>Adaptive system;Holistic;Integration;Adaptive tourist recommendation system </td><td>[1] Kabassi, K.: Personalizing recommendations for tourists.

Path planning is considered as a significantly important part in creating the path network and thus to be a necessary task for any autonomous vehicle system. This paper proposes a method that constructs the shortest path for vehicle auto-navigation in outdoor environments. The method using two layers of GIS information of online map images, which support to estimate not only the shape of road network but also the directed road. This is also the advantage as compared to methods, which use only aerial/satellite images. Accomplishing the estimation according to the use of this application requires several stages as follows. First, a raw road network is detected using the road map and the satellite image. Second, the road network is refined and represented by a direct graph. Third, the road network is converted into the global coordinate, which is much more convenient for performing online auto-navigation task than the other types of coordinate. Finally, the shortest path for motion is estimated by heuristic searching method based on a hybrid algorithm that is originated from Dijkstra algorithm in a combination with greedy breadth-first search algorithm. The experimental results demonstrate robustness and effectiveness of the proposed method for path network estimation under large scenes of outdoor environments.</td><td>Road network detection ;Autonomous navigation ;Path planning ;The shortest path estimation ;UTM/WG84 coordinate system </td><td>[1] Zhang, H., Geiger, A., Urtasun, R.: Understanding high-level semantics by modeling trafﬁc patterns.

The algorithm uses a nearest neighbor in the search population to judge whether a new point is worth evaluating, so that unnecessary evaluations can be avoided. The performance of this new scheme of differential evolution, known as differential evolution with nearest neighbor comparison (DE-NNC), is demonstrated and compared with that of standard DE as well as approximation models including differential evolution using k-nearest neighbor predictor (DE-kNN), differential evolution using speeded-up k-nearest neighbor estimator (DE-EkNN) and DE with estimated comparison method through some test functions. The results show that DE-NNC can produce considerable reduction of actual function calls compared to DE and is competitive to DE-kNN, DE-EkNN and DE with estimated comparison.</td><td>Global optimization;Differential evolution;Nearest neighbor;Function evaluation reduction </td><td>[1] Storn, R., Price, K.: Differential Evolution–A Simple and Efﬁcient Adaptive Scheme for Global Optimization Over Continuous Spaces.

The scale-invariant feature transform which extracts local descriptors from images is robust to image scale, rotation and also to changes in illumination, noise, etc. It allows to represent an image in term of the comfortable bag-of-visual-words. This representation leads to a very large number of dimensions. In this case, random forest of oblique decision trees is very efficient for a small number of classes. However, in fingerprint classification, there are as many classes as individuals. A multi-class version of random forest of oblique decision trees is thus proposed. The numerical tests on seven real datasets (up to 5,000 dimensions and 389 classes) show that our proposal has very high accuracy and outperforms state-of-the-art algorithms.</td><td>Fingerprint classification ;Scale-invariant feature transform ;Bag-of-visual-words ;Random forest of oblique decision trees </td><td>[1]Galton, F.: Finger Prints.

This paper proposes a new approach in design key-value store and presents Zing Database (ZDB) which is a high-performance persistent key-value store designed for optimizing reading and writing operations. This key-value store supports sequential write, single disk seek random write and single disk seek for read operations. Key contributions of this paper are the principles in architecture, design and implementation of a high-performance persistent key-value store. This is achieved using a data file structure organized as commit log storage where every new data are appended to the end of the data file. An in-memory index is used for supporting random reading in the commit log. ZDB architecture optimizes the index of key-value store for auto-incremental integer keys which can be applied in storing many real-life data efficiently with minimize memory overhead and reduce the complexity for partitioning data.</td><td>Key-value ;Nosql ;Storage ;Zing database ;ZDB </td><td>[1] 1.

Such an important task is the detection of defects present on fruit peel which helps to grade or to classify fruit quality. Image segmentation is usually the first step in detecting flaws in fruits and its result mainly affects the accuracy of the system. A diversity of methods of automatic segmentation for fruit images has been developed. In this paper, a hybrid algorithm, which is based on split and merge approach, is proposed for an image segmentation that can be used in fruit defect detection. The algorithm firstly uses k-means algorithm to split the original image into regions based on Euclidean color distance in \(L^*a^*b^*\) space to produce an over-segmentation result. Then, based on a graph representation, a merge procedure using minimum spanning tree is then taken into account to iteratively merge similar regions into new homogenous ones. This combination is an efficient approach to employ the local and global characteristic of intensities in the image. The experiment showed good results in the terms of human observation and in processing time.</td><td>Image segmentation;Defect detection;K-means and graph </td><td>[1] Cubero, S., et al.: Advances in machine vision applications for automatic inspection and quality evaluation of fruits and vegetables.

Petri nets (PN) are utilized here to model the EA structure as well as the agents and their cooperation. More precisely, timed PN (TPN) and first-order hybrid PN (FOHPN) are used to do this. Rooms, other spaces to be evacuated (corridors) and the safe spaces out of EA (where people are evacuated) are modelled by TPN places and FOHPN continuous places. Gate-ways are modelled by TPN subnets and by FOHPN continuous transitions. While the supervisor for the TPN gate-ways can be synthesized by means of place/transition PN (P/T PN), the blocks of FOHPN discrete places and transitions are used to affect the gate-ways. Depending on the immediate throughput of the gate-ways the escape time behaviour is found in the process of simulation. This paper is the extended version of the paper (Čapkovič Intelligent Information and Database Systems. LNAI.

When developing a CBR system from scratch, an index for case base quality supports an assessment of the actual cases. In this approach, both theory and an application are demonstrated. An index was defined and subsequently applied within a proof of concept. In addition, various approaches concerning case base quality are demonstrated. Big data occur within a combination of high velocity, great volume and variety of incoming data. New cases are suitable if they are referring to an economic value. Defining an index to measure the case base quality copes with that. In this paper, an overview of the CBR-related index towards the big picture regarding data quality can be seen. To demonstrate weighting, concrete invocations of the defined subindices are itemized with respect to applied data sets.

This framework can be useful for researchers who cannot afford expensive and dedicated clusters for infrequent demands of solving distributed computing problems. The framework also allows Internet users from social and P2P network communities to perform large data processing experiments on distributed environment. The article describes the architecture and prototyping implementation of a MapReduce P2P system. The main features of this system include exploiting leisure computing resources on P2P networks efficiently for computation, providing MapReduce operations using task management for various distributed computing problems, and supporting peer failure management for improving fault tolerance on Internet environment. We have evaluated and compared the MapReduce P2P implementation with a Hadoop MapReduce implementation on local and global-scale networks.

In contrast, truth, according to Brouwer and Heyting (intuitive logic), comes from the future. It, according to Łukasiewicz (multi-valued logic), is neither true nor false. It should be a third option that transcends both, i.e., transcends the ‘syntactic’ restrictions to reach the ‘semantic’ and ‘pragmatic’ descriptions of available data. Truth, in this case, will be formulated in the new form of the meta-concept: true-false which is neither true nor false, likewise the ‘affirmation and denial’ idea of the Indian logic. It becomes a cognitive measure used to describe the human cognitive processing. It turned out that we need not only a new term that transcends limits of words and Boolean numbers to describe meta-concepts, but also a new approach based on new philosophy, logic and mathematics to process cognitive information using both physical and mental data. It refers, in this article, as denotation computing for determining the relative density of sand using CPT data. Instead of the counter-concept, “loose or consolidation or high consolidation” we use the meta-concept, “loose-consolidation-high consolidation” to represent the objective–subjective data. Their processing is developed for certain types of data structures designed for representing information content including cognitive measures depending on perception of engineers to exceed the syntax limits of binary concepts towards their semantic and pragmatic aspects. It is based on the integration of modern philosophy, epistemology, logic, and denotational mathematics.</td><td>Geotechnical engineering;Counter-concept;Meta-concept;Cognitive measure;Cognitive information processing;Denotational mathematics </td><td>[1] Frege, F.L.G.: Über Sinn und Bedeutung.

PANNs have been applied within several branches and among them, the medical domain for clinical diagnosis, image analysis, and interpretation signal analysis, and interpretation, and drug development. For study of ADHD, we have a result of recognition electroencephalogram standards (delta, theta, alpha, and beta waves) with a median kappa index of 80 %.

The calculus has been proposed by Bibel as a generalization of some other popular approaches, like the tableau calculus or the resolution-based inference. The system is constructed in a lean deduction style and it has been inspired to some extent by a sequential reasoner leanCoP, implemented in Prolog. Our reasoner has a form of a relational program in the Oz language. In this programming model, a computational strategy is a parameter of a program having a form of a special object called a search engine. Therefore, the same program can be run in various ways, particularly in parallel on distributed machines. For this purpose, we use a parallel search engine available on the Mozart platform, which is a programming environment for Oz. We also describe results of experiments for estimating a speedup obtained by the distributed processing.</td><td>Distributed reasoning system;Connection calculus;Lean deduction;Oz language </td><td>[1] Amir, E., Maynard-Zhang, P.: Logic-based subsumption architecture.

The basic idea is to identify some particular nodes in the target network, called leader nodes, around which local communities can be computed. Being based on local computations, they are particularly attractive to handle large-scale networks. In this paper, we describe a framework for implementing LdCD algorithms, called LICOD. We propose also a new way for evaluating performances of community detection algorithms. This consists on transforming data clustering problems into a community detection problems. External criteria for evaluating obtained clusters can then be used for comparing performances of different community detection approaches. Results we obtain show that our approach outperforms top state of the art algorithms for community detection in complex networks.</td><td>Complex networks;Community detection;Leader-driven algorithms;Task-based evaluation </td><td>[1] Adamcsek, B., Palla, G., Farkas, I.J., Derényi, I., Vicsek, T.: Cﬁnder: locating cliques and overlapping modules in biological networks.

This method is aimed for any small dataset which contains only one or two training images per subject, namely Locality oriented feature extraction for small training datasets (LOFESS). In this method, gallery images are first partitioned into sub-regions excluding obstructed parts to generate a collection of initial basis vectors. Then these vectors are trained with Non-negative matrix factorization algorithm to find part-based bases. These bases finally build up a local occlusion-free feature space. The main contribution in this paper is the incorporation of locality information into LOFESS bases to preserve spatial facial structure. The presented method is applied to recognize disguised faces wearing sunglasses or scarf in a control environment without any alignment required. Experimental results on the Aleix-Robert database show the effectiveness of the LOFESS method.</td><td>Disguided face recognition;Partial occluded face recognition;Non-negative matrix factorization;Alignment free face recognition </td><td>[1] Sinha, P.: Face recognition by humans: nineteen results all computer vision researchers should know about.

Nodes can be treated as characteristic points of the object for modeling. The model of each individual symbol or data can be built by choice of probability distribution function and nodes combination. PNC modeling via nodes combination and parameter \(\gamma \) as probability distribution function enables curve parameterization and interpolation for each specific data or handwritten symbol. Two-dimensional curve is modeled and interpolated via nodes combination and different functions as discrete or continuous probability distribution functions: polynomial, sine, cosine, tangent, cotangent, logarithm, exponent, arcsin, arccos, arctan, arccot or power function.

Dealing with expert (human) knowledge consideration, Computer-Aided Diagnosis (CAD) dilemma is one of the most interesting, but also one of the most difficult problems. Among difficulties contributing to challenging nature of this problem, one can mention the need of fine classification and decision-making. In this paper, a brief survey on fault diagnosis systems is given first. Then, from a fault diagnosis system analysis of the classification and decision-making problem, a global diagnosis synopsis is deduced. Afterwards, a hybrid intelligent diagnosis approach, based on soft computing implying modular neural networks for classification and fuzzy logic for decision-making, is suggested from signal and image representations. The suggested approach is developed in biomedicine for a CAD, from Auditory Brainstem Response test, and the prototype design and experimental results are presented. In fact, a double classification is exploited in a primary fuzzy diagnosis, to ensure a satisfactory reliability. Then, this reliability is reinforced using a confidence parameter with the primary diagnosis result, exploited in a final fuzzy diagnosis giving the appropriate diagnosis with a confidence index. Indeed, experimental results demonstrate the efficiency and reliability of CAD for three classes: two auditory pathologies Retro-cochlear Class (RC) and Endo-cochlear Class (EC), and Normal auditory Class (NC). The generalization rate of NC is clearly higher for primary fuzzy diagnosis and final fuzzy diagnosis than that of the two classifications. The obtained rates for RC and EC are higher than obtained by image classification but quite similar than those obtained by signal classification. An important contribution of the final fuzzy diagnosis is the fact that a confidence index is associated with each fault diagnosis. Finally, a discussion is given with regard to the reliability and large application field of the suggested approach.</td><td>Decision support;Classification;Decision-making;Learning and adaptation;Neural networks;Fuzzy logic </td><td>[1] Balakrishnan, K., Honavar, V.: Intelligent Diagnosis Systems, Technical Report, Iowa State University, Ames, Iowa 50011–1040, U.S.A.

The alternating decision tree algorithm is used both for identifying discriminating biological features that could be used for assessing protein interaction reliability and for constructing a classifier to identify true positive interacting pairs. Experimental results show that the proposed approach has a good performance in distinguishing true interacting protein pairs from noisy protein–protein interaction data.

The major goal of reversible data hiding is to keep the reversibility of algorithm. By use of the pyramidal structure to explore the inherent characteristics of original images, regions with different smoothness levels can be determined, and then data hiding can be performed adaptively with the pre-determined threshold for balancing the output image quality and embedding capacity. On the one hand, larger capacity can be hidden into smoother regions with limited degradation of output image quality. On the other hand, the size of location map, which serves as the side information for keeping reversibility, can be reduced for embedding into smoother or less smooth regions of original image. By carefully manipulating difference values between layers in pyramidal structure, secret information can effectively be embedded. With our method, we observe better performances over relating methods with enhanced image quality, the more embedding capacity, and comparable amount of side information for decoding. More importantly, the reversibility of our method is guaranteed, meaning that original image and secret information can both be perfectly recovered at the decoder. Simulation results demonstrate that proposed method in this paper outperforms those in conventional algorithms.</td><td>Reversible data hiding;Pyramidal structure;Histogram;Quad;Image quality;Capacity </td><td>[1] Petitcolas, F.A.P., Anderson, R.J., Kuhn, M.G.: Information hiding—a survey.

We utilize some techniques such as Gabor algorithm, locally adaptive thresholding, and Hilditch’s thinning together with heuristic rules and Hamming measurement to optimally extract minutiae vector (x, y, angle, type) from fingerprint as well as to improve accuracy of matching process. Furthermore, to make our scheme robust, the minutiae vector will be converted to binary stream which is increased three times and the lowest frequency of DCT blocks of transition images or frames in H.264 video is properly chosen to hold them. With our proposed technique, the authentication scheme can achieve high capacity and good quality. Experimental results show that our proposed technique is robust against to H.264 encoder, time stretching in video, Gaussian noise, adding blur, frame removal in video, and cutting some regions in the frame of video.</td><td>Video watermarking;H.264/AVC video;Biometric authentication</td><td>[1] Ryoichi, S., Hiroshi, Y.: Consideration on copyright and illegal copy countermeasures under IT revolution.

When any company does not have sufficient budget and time for testing the entire application, a project manager can use some fault prediction algorithms to identify the parts of the system that are more defect prone. There are so many prediction approaches in the field of software engineering such as test effort, security and cost prediction. Since most of them do not have a stable model, software fault prediction has been studied in this paper based on different machine learning techniques such as decision trees, decision tables, random forest, neural network, Naïve Bayes and distinctive classifiers of artificial immune systems (AISs) such as artificial immune recognition system, CLONALG and Immunos. We use four public NASA datasets to perform our experiment. These datasets are different in size and number of defective data. Distinct parameters such as method-level metrics and two feature selection approaches which are principal component analysis and correlation based feature selection are used to evaluate the finest performance among the others. According to this study, random forest provides the best prediction performance for large data sets and Naïve Bayes is a trustable algorithm for small data sets even when one of the feature selection techniques is applied. Immunos99 performs well among AIS classifiers when feature selection technique is applied, and AIRSParallel performs better without any feature selection techniques. The performance evaluation has been done based on three different metrics such as area under receiver operating characteristic curve, probability of detection and probability of false alarm. These three evaluation metrics could give the reliable prediction criteria together.</td><td>Software fault prediction;Artificial immune system;Machine learning;AISParallel;CSCA;Random forest </td><td>[1] Zheng, J.: Predicting software reliability with neural network ensembles.

Sequential rule mining is an important research problem because it has broad application such as the analyses of customer purchases, web log, DNA sequences, and so on. However, developing an efficient algorithm for mining sequential rules is a difficult problem due to the large size of the sequential pattern set. The larger the sequential pattern set, the longer the mining time. In this paper, we propose a new algorithm called IMSR_PreTree which is an improved algorithm of MSR_PreTree that mines sequential rules based on prefix-tree. IMSR_PreTree also generates rules from frequent sequences stored in a prefix-tree but it prunes the sub trees which give non-significant rules very early in the process of rule generation and avoids tree scanning as much as possible. Thus, IMSR_PreTree can significantly reduce the search space during the mining process. Our performance study shows that IMSR_PreTree outperforms MSR_PreTree, especially on large sequence databases.</td><td>Frequent sequence;Prefix-tree;Sequential rule;Sequence database </td><td>[1] Agrawal, R., Srikant, R.: Fast algorithms for mining association rules.

Failover is a challenge issue that cannot be done successfully between physical hosts. Traditional information security using demilitarized zone approach costs a lot. Therefore, this paper introduces in-cloud enterprise resources planning (in-cloud ERP) deployed in the virtual machine cluster together with access control authentication and network security which can resolve the three problems mentioned above. Access control authentication and network security have been implemented in the cloud computing system to prevent the service-oriented hosts form external fraud, intrusion, or malicious attacks. As a result of the experiments the number of accessing in-cloud ERP is 5.2 times as many as in-house ERP. The total expenditure of in-cloud ERP has decreased significantly to 48.4 % the cost of in-house ERP. In terms of operational speed, the approach proposed in this paper outperforms two well-known benchmark ERP systems, in-house ECC 6.0 and in-cloud ByDesign.</td><td>In-cloud enterprise resources planning;Access control authentication;Biometrics;Network security;Virtual network </td><td>[1] Beloglazov, A., Buyya, R.: Energy efﬁcient allocation of virtual machines in cloud data centers.

According to the Wikipedia, big data “is a collection of data sets so large and complex that it becomes difficult to process using on-hand database management tools”. In other perceptions, the “3 Vs” that characterize it (i.e., volume, velocity, and variety) or the “4 Vs” (adding veracity to the previous three) are responsible for the fact that it exceeds an organization’s own data as well as its storage or compute capacity for accurate and timely decision-making. In essence, big data refers to the situation that more and more aspects and artifacts of everyday life, be it personal or professional, are available in digital form, e.g., personal or company profiles, social network and blog postings, buying histories, health records, to name just a few, that increasingly more data gets dynamically produced especially on the Internet and on the Web, and that nowadays the tools and techniques are available for evaluating and analyzing all that data in various combinations. Numerous companies already foresee the enormous business effects that analytical scenarios based on big data can have, and the impacts that it will hence have on advertising, commerce, and business intelligence (BI). This paper reviews the issues, techniques, and applications of big data, with an emphasis on future BI architectures.</td><td>Big data;Business intelligence;Business analytics </td><td>[1] Afrati, F., Das Sarma, A., Salihoglu, S., Ullman, J.D.: Vision paper: towards an understanding of the limits of map-reduce computation.

The underlying common assumption of many existing models is that the operating environment and the developing environment are the same. In reality, this is often not the case because the operating environments are unknown due to the uncertainty of environments in the field. In this paper, we present two new software reliability models with considerations of the fault-detection rate based on a Loglog distribution and the testing coverage subject to the uncertainty of operating environments. Examples are included to illustrate the goodness-of-fit test of proposed models and several existing non-homogeneous Poisson process (NHPP) models based on a set of failure data collected from software applications. Three goodness-of-fit test criteria, such as, mean square error, predictive-ratio risk, and predictive power, are used as an example to illustrate the model comparisons. The results show that the proposed models fit significantly better than other existing NHPP models based on the studied criteria. As we know different criteria have different impacts in measuring the software reliability and that no software reliability model is optimal for all contributing criteria. In this paper, we also discuss a method, called normalized criteria distance, to show ways to rank and select the best model from among SRGMs based on a set of criteria taken all together. Examples show that the proposed method offers a promising technique for selecting the best model based on a set of contributing criteria.</td><td>Non-homogeneous Poisson process (NHPP);Software reliability growth models;Loglog distribution;Normalized criteria distance;Operating environments </td><td>[1] Goel, A.L., Okumoto, K.: Time-dependent fault-detection rate model for software and other performance measures.

It is very important for classification and clustering problems, which may be quite difficult to solve when the amount of attributes in a given training data is very large. They usually need a very time-consuming search to get the features desired. In this paper, we will try to select features based on attribute clustering. A distance measure for a pair of attributes based on the relative dependency is proposed. An attribute clustering algorithm, called Most Neighbors First, is also presented to cluster the attributes into a fixed number of groups. The representative attributes found in the clusters can be used for classification such that the whole feature space can be greatly reduced. Besides, if the values of some representative attributes cannot be obtained from current environments for inference, some other possible attributes in the same clusters can be used to achieve approximate inference results.</td><td>Attribute clustering;Feature selection;Representative attribute;Relative dependency </td><td>[1] Al-Radaideh, Q.A., Sulaiman, M.N., Selamat, M.H., Ibrahim, H.: Approximate reduct computation by rough sets based attribute weighting.
