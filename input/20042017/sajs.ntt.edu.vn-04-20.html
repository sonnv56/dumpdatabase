However, each test has some unigue weak points. To date, there are no studies about these tests when assumptions are violated under different situations. The aim of this paper is to compare the empirical probability of the Type I error and the power of the three statistical tests under the different types of distributions: normal, uniform, student’s t, chi-square distribution and nine configurations of group size (n1, n2, n3, n4), the group variances were set as follows the ratio of 1:1:2:2, 1:2:3:4, 1:1:1:4.It was found that no test outperformed the others in terms of robustness and power. The findings showed that the Levene’s test was not the best option. Bartlett’s test is a good choice to test homogeneity of variances since it is not affected by sample sizes when the data is normally or uniform distributed. Moreover, For low skew distribution, Bartlett’stest is a good choice for small equal sample sizes and equal variances. O’Brien’s test is the best for chi-square distributed. When the variance ratio of 1:1:1:4, low skew distribution, Bartlett’s test and O’Brien’s test would be commended for small unequal sample sizes, since they still afford high power.</td><td>statistics for homogeneity of variance test;type I error;power of the tests;Bartletts test;Levenes test;OBriens test</td><td>[1] Box, G.E.P.,Non-normality and Tests on Variances.

The atmospheric meridional circulation is influencedby winter monsoon. This model is simplified from the atmospheric convectivemodel with two-dimensional Cartesian coordinates (i.e. y − zplane)based on Lorenz model. The bsifurcation diagram of the twodimensionalmodel is used for studying chaotic behavior in some range ofthe parameter F which represents an external forcing term (i.e. soil moisture)and parameter r which represents dimensionless convective term.</td><td>Atmospheric Meridional Circulation;Winter monsoon;Lorenz model;Bifurcation diagram;Chaotic Behavior</td><td>[1] Saltzman, B., Finite Amplitude Tree Convection as an Initial Value Problem-I, J. of the atmospheric sciences, 19(1962), 329-341.<br />

This paper reportsthe results from an empirical study, which has evaluated student’s developmentquantitative literacy sub-competencies in the mathematizationenvironment that situations have the same complexity. For this purpose,we designed mathematization situations, constructed a measure ofcomplexity of situations and a rubric to grade student work, taught experiment,collected and analyzed data.

To study the toxicity of nanoparticles, we investigatethe penetration of nanocylindrical carbon entering a lipid bilayer. We determinethe interaction energy between the carbon nanocylinder and alipid bilayer, looking at the penetration mechanism for appropriate carbonnanocylinder size. By applying the Lennard-Jones potential functionand continuous approximation, the interaction energy is analysed by numericalevaluations, obtained by performing surface or volume integrals.Using this model, it has been indicated that the carbon nanocylinderwith the radius and the half length of 3.55 °A will penetrate through thelipid bilayer when the hole radius of the lipid is larger than 6.65 °A. Itpenetrates deeper as the hole size gets larger.

Strength 4 OAs allow us to also separately estimate all twofactorinteractions. These arrays are in great demand not only in wellknownareas like statistical quality control of industries and services [12],software engineering [13], but also in emerging and fast-developed areassuch as computational biology, drug designs and/or medical sciences, inparticular DNA micro-array experiments [6, 21].In this paper, we introduce some new methods for constructing mixedorthogonal arrays of strength t, with a given parameter set of run-sizeand factor levels.

A welding torchmounted at the end of a manipulator of the welding mobile manipulator(WMM) must be controlled for tracking a welding path with constantvelocity and constant welding angle of torch. In this paper, a decentralizedcontrol method is applied to control the WMM considered as twoseparate subsystems such as a mobile platform and a manipulator. Twodecentralized motion controllers are designed to control two subsystemsof WMM, respectively. Firstly, based on a tracking error vector of themanipulator and a feedback motion of the mobile platform, a kinematiccontroller is designed for manipulator. Secondly, based on an anothertracking error vector of the mobile platform and a feedback angular velocitiesof revolution joints of three-link, a sliding mode controller is designedfor the mobile platform. These controllers are obtained based onthe Lyapunovs function and its stability condition to ensure for the trackingerror vectors to be asymptotically stable.

For any two points p, q ∈ G, the ratio of the distance between p and q on the graph G to the distance between these two points is called the detour between p and q. The worst-case detour δ(G) of a graph G is called the geometric dilation of G. The geometric dilation problem in the Euclidean plane asks for a simple planar graph with smallest geometric dilation to embed a given finite set S.

Most current computational trust models are mainlybased on two basic factors: personal experience trust and reference truston a single issue of trust. These models may be not very fruitful whenapplying to trust systems with multi-issue, in which agents need to infera trust of some new issue from trusted issues. This status occurs due tolack of information or uncertainty on both experience trust and referencetrust of the issue. In this paper, we introduce a trust model that is anextension of the single issue trust one to a multi-issue trust one. Ourapproach is to investigate a new type of trust - inference trust, and thento integrate it into this extension model. The new trust may enableagents to discover his local knowledge about their partners to infer thenew trust of their partners on some issue.</td><td>mathematical model;trust;reputation;inference trust;multiagent system. 2000 AMS Mathematics Subject Classification: Applied Mathematics</td><td>[1] J.

We defined that two compartments      are adjacent ifand only if they share a common edge. In this paper, we considered theregular tilings of regular             polygons in Euclidean plane.An assignment problem can have weighted and nonweighted           neighborhoodconstraints. Weights ωg and ωg are assigned to sets g and g,respectively. The cost of having an element from set g adjacent to anelement of set g is computed as |ωg − ωg|. In an assignment problemwith weighted neighborhood constraint, the higher adjacency costs areminimized first.In an assignment problem with nonweighted neighborhood constraint,the costs of the adjacencies between elements of different sets are simultaneouslyminimized, and the weights are considered as dummy only. Theeffect of the dummy weights can be removed by permuting the weightsin the objective function of the binary integer program. The binary integerprogram associated with the assignment problem with nonweightedneighborhood constraint is computationally more expensive than the assignmentproblem with weighted constraint.We can represent the tilings as graphs and the assignment problems aslinearized binary integer programs.

Then, while the mobile node transfers communicationfrom one access point to another access point - called handover orhandoff, it is not able to send or receive data. Predicting mobility isone of the prominent solutions for reducing the handover latency. Severalapproaches to the prediction have been considered such as HiddenMarkov models, machine learning, data mining and so on. The data miningapproach investigates the log file of node mobility history to predictits next move. In such a context, the spatial attributes of a mobile nodeare changing over time, and therefore time constraints between mobilelocations play an crucial role. However, the current studies on mobilityprediction are not satisfactory since spatial and temporal attributes ofdata are not considered simultaneously.In this paper, we introduce a formal model of mobility based on spatialand temporal attributes of data in the wireless network. Based on thismodel, we construct mobility patterns and weighted mobility rules andthen develop algorithms for discovering these patterns and rules. The discovered rules will be utilized in predicting the location of mobile nodein the wireless network.</td><td>mobitity modeling;mobility prediction;pattern;rule;spatiotemporality. 2000 AMS Mathematics Subject Classiﬁcation: Applied Mathematics</td><td>[1] Jean-Marc Francois, Performing and Making Use of Mobility Prediction, Doctor thesis, University of Lyte, (2007).<br />

In this case, the coordinate of a vertex v is defined asthe distances from vertex v to the ordered partition classes in Π. In thispaper, we discuss the locating-chromatic number for a corona product oftwo graphs.</td><td>locating-chromatic number;corona graph. 2000 AMS Mathematics Subject Classiﬁcation: 05C15</td><td>[1] Asmiati, E.T.
