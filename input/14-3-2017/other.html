<tr valign="top"><td>The Effect of Taxation and Corruption on Firm Growth: An Empirical Investigation for Vietnam</td><td>Nuclear Science and Technology</td><td>18</td><td>3</td><td>2016</td><td>en</td><td>The aim of this study is to analyze empirically the impact of taxation and corruption on the  growth of manufacturing firms in Vietnam. The study employed pooled OLS estimation and then  instrument variables with fixed effect for the panel data of 1377 firms in Vietnam from 2005 to  2011. These data were obtained from the survey of the Central Institute for Economic Management  and the Danish International Development Agency. The results show that both taxation and  corruption are negatively associated with firm growth measured by firm sales adjusted according  to the GDP deflator. A one-percentage point increase in the bribery rate is linked with a reduction  of 16,883 percentage points in firm revenue, over four and a half times bigger than the effect of  a one-percentage point increase in the tax rate. From the findings of this research, the author  recommends the Vietnam government to lessen taxation on firms and that there should be an  urgent revolution in anti-corruption policies as well as bureaucratic improvement in Vietnam.</td><td>Bribery rate;corruption;instrument variable;fixed–effect method;panel data;small and medium enterprises;taxation;Vietnamese firms.</td><td>[1] Angrist, J. and Krueger, A.

This paper aims to  investigate the impacts on the economic well-being of old-age parents of domestic remittances,  sent by their children who have migrated from rural to urban areas. Using data from the Vietnam  Household Living Standard Survey (VHLSS) in 2004, 2008 and 2012 with logistic regression  models, we found that domestic remittances played an essential role in improving income/  expenditure per capita and reducing poverty rates of older people’s households. Domestic  remittances also contributed to reduce Gini coefficients, which were calculated using both income  and expenditure per capita.</td><td>Aging;migration;domestic remittances;older people;Vietnam.</td><td>[1] Antman, F.

We explore a panel data set of  61 listed SMEs in Vietnam from 2011 to 2014 and apply random-effects models to test whether  the financing policy affects firm performance. It is found that leverage policy has a significantly  positive impact on Tobin’s q and a negative impact on ROE of the listed SMEs.

To achieve those objectives, the research utilises both  quantitative and qualitative exploratory approaches. Data were collected from surveys and indepth  interviews at 109 international joint ventures in Vietnam, including dyadic data from 68  local manager-expatriate duos. Through the survey, this research confirms the hypothesis that  expatriation fosters tacit knowledge transfer. It also suggests that receivers have a stronger  impact on knowledge acquisition than providers. In addition, we find that among various types  of knowledge being transferred in expatriate-local manager interactions, only ‘acquired tacit  professional’ knowledge affects local managers’ performance.</td><td>Expatriates;local managers;knowledge acquisition;Vietnam;cross-culture management;knowledge transfer.</td><td>[1] Al Ariss, A.

A lot of research has focused on how these activities are coordinated and how interfirm  transactions are governed. However, the existing literature is neither complete nor clear  enough to understand how external and internal factors influence the shaping of a firm’s choice of  mechanisms to govern transactions along the supply chain. Building from the existing literature,  this paper proposes a conceptual model with two dimensions. The dimension of determinants  includes three components: institution environment, industry structure and transaction  characteristics. The dimension of governance patterns consists of five mechanisms a firm may  use to govern its economic transactions along the supply chain: market contract, production  contract, relational contract, relational production contract, and hierarchy. The paper provides  prescriptions for the firm’s choice among five supply chain governance patterns under different  conditions of the above three components of determinants.</td><td>Governance pattern;determinant;supply chain;transaction cost.</td><td>[1] Bair, J.

This study aims to operationalize and  measure career success of rural to urban migrant laborers in Ho Chi Minh City, Vietnam by  developing an integrated index. The Partial Least Squares-Structural Equation Model (PLS-SEM)  with a combination of both reflective and formative constructs is applied. Employing the primary  data of 419 migrant laborers in a survey conducted in Ho Chi Minh City, Vietnam in 2015, the  hierarchical model confirms the statistically significant contribution of objective and subjective  components to the career success index. Compared to objective career success, subjective career  success has a stronger effect on the index. Five dimensions of career success are distinguished  including: 1) job satisfaction, 2) career satisfaction, 3) life satisfaction, 4) other-referent criteria  and 5) promotion. The first four and the final one are categorized as subjective career success  and objective career success respectively. Among the four dimensions of subjective success, job  satisfaction, career satisfaction and life satisfaction share lesser weights than success using otherreferent  criteria in the model. This finding implies that other-referent criteria play an important  role when people evaluate their career success. The index shall provide a general picture of the  career success of rural to urban migrant laborers in Ho Chi Minh City and give an empirical  result for further micro-research on career success determination.</td><td>Vietnam;career success;formative;hierarchical;reflective modeling</td><td><br />[1] Arthur, M.

The study finds that in line with recent theoretical literature, institutional factors such as business support service, land access, time costs, and informal charges promote firm growth in terms of both employment and capital.

The Chow tests show that urban and rural older people were not different in perceived financial satisfaction, while male and female people clearly were. Two separate logistic regression models for male and female older people were applied to discover determining factors of their perceived financial satisfaction. The findings generally showed that older women usually had lower probability for financial satisfaction than did men. Educational level, living area, and financial factors for both males and females played significant roles in making older people satisfied with their financial situations. The paper also indicates that there was a higher probability of financial satisfaction for those who received financial support from their children. The results also imply that there was no relationship between the work situation of older people and their perceived financial satisfaction, although working in later life could help older people increase their income.</td><td>Aging;gender;financial satisfaction;older people;Vietnam</td><td>[1] Andrews, Frank M., and Withey, Stephen B.

The data set consists of one input variable, which is the number of academic staff, and three output variables in which the number of research hours is considered as research output and the number of graduates and teaching load are defined as teaching outputs. Particularly, the output-oriented CCR, BCC, and SBM model under both the CRS and VRS assumptions are applied in order to determine accurate degrees of efficiency of individual departments and directions for performance improvement for less efficient ones. The output-oriented radial Malmquist DEA model is also employed to make a comparative analysis of the productivity change of the departments over the period. The results reveal some clear policy-making implications for departments to adjust their development plan in an appropriate way.</td><td>Data envelopment analysis;relative efficiency;higher education institution;academic departments’ efficiency</td><td>[1] Abbott, M. and Doucouliagos, C.

A survey of 136 employees of a public university in Hanoi, targeted at managers, lecturers and researchers having more than a 5-year working experience, was conducted in 2015. Multiple regression techniques were used to analyse the data.

The results indicate that the extent of Vietnam’s intra-industry trade is positively correlated with average country size and average income levels, while it is negatively correlated with income inequality, distance, and trade imbalance. Those factors affect horizontal intra-industry trade (HIIT) and vertical intra-industry trade (VIIT) in the same way except for the effect of income inequality (DPCI) on VIIT with an unexpectedly statistically insignificant impact. The coefficient of FTA is unexpectedly insignificant in three estimations, indicating an ambiguous effect of the participation in regional economic integration schemes on the share of IIT, HIIT and VIIT.</td><td>Vietnam;manufacturing sector;IIT;HIIT;VIIT.</td><td><br />[1] Balassa, B, and L.

The empirical evidence confirms the significant impact of market potential, labour cost, labour quality, infrastructure, provincial policy effectiveness, and the previous year’s FDI concentration on FDI allocation between provinces and cities in Vietnam. Also, market potential and wage rate are statistically shown to affect the size of FDI projects. Moreover, estimation results suggest that provinces with higher FDI accumulation seem to create a dispersion force to new foreign investors and FDI between regions in Vietnam in the form of efficiency-seeking FDI.</td><td>Foreign direct investment (FDI);market potential;regional determinants.</td><td>[1] Ali, S. and Guo, W.(2005), ‘Determinants of FDI in China’, Journal of Global Business and Technology, 1(2), 21-33.<br />[2] Anwar, S. and Nguyen, P.L.

However, less is known about what factors drive employees to perform adaptive behavior. This research aims to investigate the antecedents and consequences of adaptive behavior (including interpersonal and service offering adaptive behaviors) of frontline employees in the health care service. Based on the data of 418 cases of physicians working at public and private hospitals and clinics, the analysis reveals that interpersonal adaptive behavior is positively affected by employee’s work enjoyment, competence, and autonomy, while service offering adaptive behavior is positively influenced by work enjoyment and competence. In addition, both types of adaptive behavior of frontline employees have significant effects on employee’s service performance. The findings provide benefits to hospital managers. Since work enjoyment, competence, and autonomy positively affect physicians’ adaptive behavior, which then leads to better performance, adequate training on professional knowledge and interpersonal skills for health care practitioners as well as appropriate empowerment practices are highly recommended.</td><td>Employee adaptive behavior;employee service performance;health care service;work autonomy;work competence;work enjoyment.</td><td>[1] Amabile, T.

Data were collected from 220 medium-to-large enterprises. Follow-up interviews were conducted with 20 accounting heads/vice heads to obtain further information and clarification. The quantitative data collected was analyzed using both descriptive and inferential statistics (including t-tests and structural equation modeling), while the qualitative data was used to shed further light on the various relationships described by the quantitative analysis. This paper reveals that both decentralization and competition have a positive, significant influence on the use of new MAPs except for the old ones. Consequently, the use of MAPs has a positive, significant influence on enterprise performance.</td><td>Management accounting practices;competition;decentralization;performance;Vietnam.</td><td>[1] Abdel-Kader, M., and Luther, R.

The paper is based on over 75 papers published by top peer reviewed journals in marketing throughout the world over the past three decades. The results show that the SLR is suggested to be positive. However, this relationship could be linear or nonlinear depending on the nature, the different approaches of measure and definition of satisfaction and loyalty. Moreover, the relationship is affected by many moderators, mediators and other variables. Future research should extend to test other antecedents besides satisfaction and to use different definitional approaches of satisfaction and loyalty to explain loyalty. Different functional forms of the SLR, moderators and mediators are also recommended to test in a separate or combined approach to shed light on the complex nature of this relationship.</td><td>The satisfaction–loyalty relationship;nonlinear;moderators;mediators.</td><td><br />[1] Agustin, C. and Singh, J.

The author also investigates whether greater remittances consistently increase corruption among the most and least corrupt countries. Our results show that among the least corrupt countries, remittances do not appear to increase corruption but significantly promote corruption among most corrupt countries. Our findings are robust for different sample specifications, for regional effects and for alternative econometrics techniques.</td><td>Corruption;remittances;panel data;quantile regression.</td><td>[1] Abdih, Y., Chami, R., Dagher, J., and Montiel, P.

Several sectors in which Vietnam has revealed a comparative advantage, has benefited from the AFTA, and would continue to enjoy trade creation from the RCEP, are: Cereals (10), Salt, sulphur, earth, stone, plaster, lime and cement (25), Rubber (40), Knitted or crocheted fabric (60), etc. More importantly, the result provides a list of commodities in which Vietnam has a comparative advantage and only experiences trade creation when participating in the RCEP. These are: Milling products, malt, starches, inulin, wheat gluten (11), Vegetable plaiting materials, vegetable products not elsewhere specified (14), Wood and articles of wood, wood charcoal (44), etc. Findings also show commodities in which Vietnam has a comparative advantage; but are not well positioned in the RCEP market yet, e.g. Cereal, flour, starch, milk preparations and products (19) and Manmade staple fibres (55). If sufficient investment decisions and marketing strategies are applied to these commodities, they will well penetrate the RCEP market and bring trade creation and welfare improvement to Vietnam. Public and private investment should consider the above-mentioned commodities as targets to leapfrog the benefits of RCEP.</td><td>Regional trade agreement;ASEAN;RCEP;impact assessment;trade indicators.</td><td>[1] B.

The study reveals a positive relationship between economic growth and FDI, GFCF and TOP. This study establishes a strong unidirectional causal flow from changes in FDI, trade openness and capital formation to the economic growth rates of India. The impulse response function traces the positive influence of these macro variables on the GDP growth rates of India. The study also reveals that the volatility of GDP growth rates in India is mainly attributed to the variation in the level of GFCF and FDI. The study concludes that the FDI inflows and the size of capital formation are the main determinants of economic growth. In view of this, it is expected that the government of India should provide more policy focus on promoting FDI inflows and domestic capital formations to increase its economic growth in the long-term.</td><td>GDP growth;FDI;capital formation;trade openness;India.</td><td>[1] Adhikary, B.

Moreover, the paper also analyzed the impact of social capital on life satisfaction and risk coping strategies. Results of regression models confirmed that social capital is the essential ingredient for the life satisfaction of the community and at the same time, social capital also has notable impacts on households’ post-risk recovery. In the relationship with the life satisfaction, all the variables representing social capital, except for general trust, positively affected the growth of life satisfaction of households, aside from physical factors such as income. Therefore, social capital, along with economic growth, was the biggest factor that can help households increase their life satisfaction.</td><td>Social capital;bonding social capital;bridging social capital;linking social capital;life satisfaction.</td><td>[1] Akçomak, İ.

Although there have been many positive developments, there is still a big gap in the economy when agricultural and rural areas are compared with urban areas; many agricultural households are still living in poverty. With the assumption that the improvement of access to capital will help people escape from poverty to become rich, this paper provides evidence of determinants of access to bank credit, as well as the granted amount of credit capital for agricultural households. The data is collected from a survey of 1560 agricultural households , conducted in August 2013. The results show that the level of education of the householder, value of collateral, household income, householder experience and credit history, can affect access to bank credit.</td><td>Access to bank;agricultural households.</td><td>[1] Abi Kedir (2002), ‘Determinants of Access to Credit and Loan Amount: Household-level Evidence from Urban Ethiopia’, Journal of African Economies, Vol.10, No.3, pp. 390-409.<br />[2] Armendáriz B and Morduch J (2005), The Economics of Microfinance, The MIT Press Cambridge, Massachusetts, London, England.<br />[3] Hosmer D and Lemeshew S (1989), Applied Logistic Regression, New York: Wiley-Inter Science Publication.<br />[4] Le Thanh Ngoc (2014), ‘Housing Bubble in Ho Chi Minh City’, Dotor Thesis, Banking University of Ho Chi Minh.<br />[5] Pham Thi Thu Tra and Robert Lensink (2007), ‘Lending Policies of Formal, Informal and Semi-Formal Lenders: Evidence from Vietnam’, Economics of Transition, Vol.15, Issue 2, pp. 181-209.<br />[6] Robert Lensink, Nguyen Van Ngan, and Le Khuong Ninh (2008), ‘Deternimants of Farming Household’s Access to Formal Credit in the Mekong Delta, Vietnam’, CDS Research Paper No. 27, December 2008, p.205-224.<br />[7] Takahashi (2010), ‘The Short-term Poverty Impact of Small Scale, Collateral free Microcredit in Indonesia: A Matching Estimator Approach’, The Developing Economics, Vol.48, No.1, pp. 128-155.<br />[8] Tran Tho Dat (1998), ‘Borrower Transactions Costs and Credit Rationing: a Study of the Rural Credit Market in Vietnam’.

More specifically, the key points are: (i) introducing a scheme where contract transfer is proceeded with even in the event that no savior insurance company steps forward, and placing emphasis on the indemnification of coverage-based insurance products in which the market is expected to grow, (ii) increasing the burden on policyholders of conventional deposit-based products, for example, a reduction of assumed interest rates, in an effort to increase necessary financial resources, (iii) developing professionals who are specialized in evaluating the values of bankrupt insurance companies and (iv) promoting thorough information disclosure and validating the soundness index.</td><td>Consistency with market;macro coverage rate;policyholders’ protection fund</td><td>[1] Finance Service Agency (2008), Bankruptcy of Yamato Life, Policy reports, pp. 1-9.<br />[2] Kubo H.

This paper aims to identify the determinants of the Vietnamese older people’s decision to be active in the labor force. We used data from the Vietnam Aging Survey (VNAS) in 2011 - the first-ever nationally representative survey on older people - which comprised 2,789 respondents. We employed probit models and other statistical methods in order to ensure the validity of the results. The paper demonstrated that various individual factors (such as age and health status) and household-related factors (such as area of living) significantly contributed to older people’s decision about participating in the labor force. More interestingly, the effects of the above factors were statistically and significantly different for males and females and those living in urban and rural areas. To reach ‘active ageing’ in terms of work and income security, Vietnam should have some immediate and long-term solutions so to encourage the participation of older people in the  labor force and improve their health and living conditions.</td><td>Ageing;gender;labor force participation;Vietnam</td><td>[1] Adhikari, R., K.

Specifically, the relative factors determining trade in the popular gravity model have effects on the trade balance model. The trade balance depends on the relative GDP, relative per capita GNI, real exchange rate and import-weighted distance proxies for transportation cost of the partner countries to the home country. Using standard panel data techniques during the 1991-2013 period, the model is empirically tested and the results show significant effects of all the relative factors on the bilateral trade balance of Bangladesh in trading with BRICS countries. The robustness check of the model ensures the validity of the specification. The static panel data analysis explores the cross-country variations as well as the time-invariant country-specific effects on trade balance with heterogeneous economies and finds significant effects of all relative factors on the trade balance of Bangladesh.</td><td>Bilateral trade;BRICS;panel data model</td><td>[1] Anderson, J.

We employ secondary data collected from published audited consolidated financial reports of Vietnamese commercial banks from 2008, the year marking the outbreak of the global financial crisis, to the end of 2012. Altogether, the data constitute 175 panel-data observations. The regression using the ordinary least squares method yields the result that operating expense, management quality, risk aversion, and inflation rate have a positive effect on NIM, while the banking sector’s market concentration affects NIM negatively. Afterwards, some policy implications are derived from those findings to mitigate and put NIM under control, so that the efficiency of the financial intermediary system can be developed.</td><td>Determinants;net interest margin;commercial banks</td><td>[1] Abreu, M., and Mendes, V.

The authors use survey data of 516 customers from the three largest mobile communication providers in Vietnam. A moderated regression is used to test the hypotheses of both two- and three-way interaction effects on repurchase intention. The results show that monetary, time, effort and social ties switching costs have a negative moderating effect, but relational switching costs have a positive moderating effect on the satisfaction-repurchase intention relationship. Furthermore, this study contributes to the existing literature by providing empirical evidence supporting three-way interaction effects between satisfaction, switching costs and customer expertise on repurchase intention. Specifically, customer expertise reduces the moderating effects of social ties and relational switching costs on the satisfaction-repurchase intention relationship.</td><td>Satisfaction;repurchase intention;switching costs;customer expertise;interactions</td><td><br />[1] Aiken, L.S. and West, S.G.

A survey of 36 companies out of 200 software companies in Hanoi and Ho Chi Minh city, targeted at 900 technical staff, middle managers and top managers, was conducted. The study findings, based on a sample response rate of 24 per cent, indicated that a culture of high solidarity, adaptability and collaboration was proved to have the strongest impact on the process of knowledge transfer and company performance. It was also found that a transparent and flexible incentive system motivated individuals to exchange and utilize knowledge in their daily work, that a high level of centralization and formalization hindered the flow of knowledge, and the effect of IT tools on the knowledge transfer process remained weak. Overall, the findings of the study indicated that organizational factors and intra-organizational knowledge transfer processes have positive correlations with organizational performance.</td><td>Intra-organizational knowledge transfer;organizational performance;IT companies</td><td>[1] Al-Alawi, A.

It is shown that the assumption of the independence among spatial units (provinces in this case) is unrealistic, being in contrast to the evidence of the data reflecting the spatial interaction and the existence of spatial lag and errors. Therefore, neglecting the spatial nature of data can lead to a misspecification of the model. We decompose the sample data into the  sub-periods 1998-2002 and 2003-2011 for the analysis. Different tests point out that the spatial lag model is appropriate for the whole period of the sample data (1998-2011) and the sub-period (2003-2011), therefore, we employ the maximum likelihood procedure to estimate the spatial lag model. The estimation results allow us to recognize that the convergence model without a spatial lag variable and using ordinary least square to estimate has the problem of omitting variables, which will have impact on the estimated measure of convergence speed. And this problem dominates the positive effect of factors such as mobilizing factors, trade relation, and knowledge spillover in the regional scope.</td><td>Spatial econometric;spatial weight matrix;spatial lag model;spatial error model;I-Moran index.</td><td><br />[1] Abramovitz M.

This study applies VAR analysis to evaluate the monetary transmission mechanisms to output and price level. To compare the relative importance of different channels for transmitting monetary policy, the paper estimates the impulse response functions and variance decompositions of variables. The empirical results show that the changes in money supply have a significant impact on output rather than price in the short run. The impacts of money supply on price and output are stronger through the exchange rate and credit channels, but however, are weaker through the interest rate channel. The impacts of monetary policy on output and inflation may be erroneous through the equity price channel because of the lack of an established and well-functioning stock market.</td><td>Monetary transmission channel;output;price;VAR;Vietnam.</td><td>[1] Aleem, Abdul.

This paper investigates the challenging issue of financial distress in Vietnam by distinguishing “healthy” companies from “financially distressed” companies using a data sample of firms listed on the Ho Chi Minh City Stock Exchange. Employing the logistic regression model to predict financial distress with a unique data set, we characterize the determinants of financial distress in terms of firm accounting and financial ratios over the period from 2007 to 2012. The results indicate that financial ratios can be employed as an early warning of financial distress as financial ratios are significantly correlated with the probability of firm financial distress.</td><td>Financial distress;insolvency;logit.</td><td>[1] Altman, E.I.

Conventionally, audit quality is defined as a probability that financial statements are free from material misstatements. The existence of a positive relationship between audit firm size and audit quality has long been accepted in previous literature. This has resulted in numerous studies collecting evidence of differential audit quality relative to the size of audit firms, both large and small. Consequently, the conclusion has been asserted that larger audit firms produce a higher and more homogenous audit quality. The collapse of Arthur Andersen, however, has undermined the premise that large audit firms provide higher audit quality than smaller firms. This research investigates audit quality based on the extent of compliance levels with disclosure requirements pertaining to goodwill impairment of large listed Hong Kong firms in the third year transition to International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS). The result found that audit firm identity appears to be a significant proportion of cross-sectional variation, in which compliance levels and disclosure quality varied considerably among auditors.</td><td>Goodwill accounting;audit quality;HKAS 36;impairment testing;Hong Kong.</td><td>[1] Balvers, R J., Macdonald, B and Miller, R E (1988), ‘Underpricing of New Issues and the Choice of Auditor as a Signal of Investment Banker Reputation’, The Accounting Review, Vol. 63, Issue. 4, pp. 605–622.<br />[2] Becker, C L., Defond, M L and Subramanyam, K R (1998), ‘The Effect of Audit Quality on Earnings Management’, Contemporary Accounting Research, Vol. 15, Issue. 1, pp. 1-24.<br />[3] Behn, B K., Choi, J H and Kang, T (2008), ‘Audit Quality and Properties of Analyst Earnings Forecast’, The Accounting Review, Vol. 83, Issue. 2, pp. 327-349.<br />[4] Blokdijk, H., Drieenhuizen, F., Simunic, D A and Stein, M T (2003), ‘Determinants of the Mix of Audit Procedures: Key Factors that Cause Auditors to Change What They Want’, Accessed on 20th December, 2014, from http://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=415200.<br />[5] Boon, K (2007), Compulsory Audit Tendering and Audit Quality: Evidence from Australian Local Government, Macquarie University.<br />[6] Caneghem, T V (2004), ‘The Impact of Audit Quality on Earnings Rounding-up Behaviour: Some UK Evidence, European Accounting Review, Vol.13, Issue. 4, pp. 771–786.<br />[7] Carlin, T M., Finch, N and Ford, G (2007), ‘Are All Audits Born Equal?’, Journal of Applied Research in Accounting and Finance, Vol. 2, Issue. 1, pp. 21–32.<br />[8] Carlin, T M., Finch, N and Khairil, F K (2010), ‘Singapore Audit Quality and the Complexity of FRS 36 Disclosures Requirements’, International Review of Business Research Papers, Vol. 6, No. 2, pp. 81-94.<br />[9] Carlin, T M., Finch, N and Laili, N H (2009), ‘Investigating Audit Quality Among Big 4 Malaysian Firms’, Asian Review of Accounting, Vol. 17, Issue. 2, pp. 96–114.<br />[10] Chaney, P K and Philipich, K L (2002), ‘Shredded Reputation: The Cost of Audit Failure’, Journal of Accounting Research, Vol. 40, Issue. 4, pp. 1221–1245.<br />[11] Copley, P A (1991), ‘The Association Between Municipal Disclosure Practices and Audit Quality’, Journal of Accounting and Public Policy, Vol. 10, Issue. 4, pp. 245–266.<br />[12] Copley, P A., Doucet, M S and Gaver, K M (1994), ‘A Simultaneous Equations Analysis of Quality Control Review Outcomes and Engagement Fees for Audit of Recipients of Federal Financial Assistance’, The Accounting Review, Vol. 69, Issue.1, pp. 244–256.<br />[13] Dang, L (2004), Assessing Actual Audit Quality, Drexel University.<br />[14] Deangelo, L E (1981), ‘Audit Size and Audit Quality’, Journal of Accounting and Economics, Vol. 3, pp. 183–199.<br />[15] Defond, M L and Jiambalvo, J (1991), ‘Incidence and Circumstances of Accounting Errors’, The Accounting Review, Vol. 66, Issue.3, pp. 643–655.<br />[16] Donald R, Deis, J and Giroux, G A (1992), ‘Determinants of Audit Quality in the Public Sector’, The Accounting Review, Vol. 67, Issue.3, pp. 462–479.<br />[17] Eisenberg, T and Macey, J R (2003), ‘Was Arthur Andersen Different?

The Generalised Canonical Analysis is applied to evaluate the meaning of the ‘Don’t Know’ answer which often exists in response to questions on perception of corruption. The results reveal that ‘Don’t Know’ implies corruption. The paper then, shows that a high level of transparency is accompanied with a low level of perception of corruption while impacts of accountability on corruption are mixed. Furthermore, corruption is a critical factor that deteriorates the administration performance whereas transparency and accountability are ineffective in being translated into the quality of administrative services. The results raise the need to closely examine the de-facto forms of transparency and accountability as well as the political will in the fight against corruption to improve the quality of public administrative services in Vietnam.</td><td>Governance;public administration performance;corruption;multiple correspondence analysis;canonical correlation analysis.</td><td>[1] Acuna-Alfaro, J.

A stage-setting survey of analytical framework and empirical evidence of employment transformation in a labor-abundant economy in East Asia has enabled a statistical analysis of employment transformation in Vietnam over the two recent decades. The findings suggest that the manufacturing sector has shown an improved performance in attracting massive amounts of unskilled workers from agriculture. Within manufacturing, the private sector firms, in particular the foreign-invested enterprises, have been increasingly responsible for job creation, contributing to the gradual erosion of the dominant state enterprises.</td><td>Employment transformation;structural change;labor-abundance;manufacturing employment;private sector firms.</td><td>[1] Athukorala, P and Manning, C (1999), Structural change and international migration in East Asia :<br />[2] adjusting to labour scarcity, Oxford University Press, South Melbourne.<br />[3] Athukorala, P., Manning, C and Wickaramasekara, P (2000), Growth employment and migration in Southeast Asia : structural change in the greater Mekong countries, Edward Elgar, Cheltenham, UK ; Northampton, Mass.<br />[4] Bai, MK (1985), ‘The turning point in the Korean economy’, The Developing Economies, Vol. 20, No. 2, pp. 117-40.<br />[5] Basu, K (2003), Analytical development economics: the less developed economy revisited, the MIT press, Cambrigde, Massachusetts.<br />[6] CIEM [Central Institute for Economic Management] (2008), Vietnam economy in 2007, Hanoi.<br />[7] Diehl, M (1995), ‘Structural change in the economic transformation process: Vietnam 1986-1993’, Economic Systems, Vol. 19, No. 2, pp. 147-182.<br />[8] Fei, J and Ranis, G (1964), Development of the labor surplus economy : theory and policy, R.D.

This paper explores the determinants of corporate financial distress of Vietnamese firms listed on the Hochiminh Stock Exchange using a dynamic logit model. We find that financially distressed enterprises have highly leveraged capital structures with low liquidity and low profitability. The financial distress probability is more pronounced for firms with small capitalization as well as those newly established and less profitable. With the hope of improving market efficiency, we finally come up with a simple, convenient model which helps investors estimate a firm’s financial distress probability without information cost.</td><td>Financial distress;emerging market;logit regression.</td><td>[1] Altman, E.I (1968), ‘Financial Ratios, Discriminant Analysis, and Prediction of Corporate Bankruptcy’, Journal of Finance, Vol. 23, No. 4, pp. 589-610.<br />[2] Andrade, G., and Kaplan, S.

Livelihood adaptation plays a vital role in mitigating vulnerabilities, increasing resilience, and achieving sustainable income and food security in the long term. Drawing on quantitative data from a case study in three coastal districts of Nam Dinh province in Vietnam, this paper investigates vulnerability and adaptation of coastal livelihoods to the impacts of climate change at a household level. Findings suggest that (i) climate change has positive effects on livelihood assets, especially natural and physical capital; (ii) the more livelihood assets are affected by climate change, the more livelihood strategies are affected; (iii) the more livelihood strategies are affected by climate change, the more livelihood outcomes are affected, and (iv) households are implementing passive adaptation activities on their livelihoods rather than active ones to counter the impacts of climate change. It is recommended that in order to help households successfully adapt to the impacts of climate change, it is necessary for the government to support households to improve their livelihood assets, especially natural and physical capital, and to enhance institutions and policies on climate change adaptation at national and local levels.</td><td>Adaptation, climate change, coastal area, livelihoods, vulnerability</td><td>[1] ADB [Asia Development Bank] (2009), Economic Impact of Climate Change in South East Asia: Regional Report – Highlights, Asia Development Bank Report.<br />[2] Armitage, D. and Plummer, R.

This dispute between the USA and Vietnam is known as  the “Catfish War”. Based on monthly time series data from January 1999 to December 2011, an econometric approach is considered, in which regression models are taken into account for investigating how the USA AD measures impact on the volume and the value of Vietnam’s pangasius exports. As resulted in the estimation, the paper found that although the anti-dumping taxes  imposed on Vietnam pangasius, it is not so seriously problematic for exporters in the  long-term. One of the reasons is that Vietnam pangasius exporters are dynamic in developing market diversification by shifting from the USA to the European market.. However, in the short term, the trade dispute between the USA and Vietnam is a warning alarm for Vietnam pangasius exporters. In addition, the paper does not have any evidence to confirm that the upward trend of the real exchange rate between the VND and the USD is causing changes in either the pangasius export volume or the pangasius export value. Also there is no confirmation of a significant relationship between the inflation rate in Vietnam and the export value.</td><td>Aquaculture, Vietnam pangasius, anti-dumping</td><td>[1] Binh, T. V.

This study examines the relationship between internal integration and functional performance.  It also examines the three key antecedents to internal integration: communication, leader support and conflict. A questionnaire survey is used to collect data from a sample of 152 production managers. The data are analyzed using regression. The results indicate that communication, conflict and leader support are antecedents of internal integration and also impact functional performance. Internal integration is also found to mediate the relationships between communication and leader support with functional performance, but not for the relationships between conflict and functional performance. This is also the contribution of the paper, which is the first to examine and suggest these mediating effects between communication, leader support, internal integration and functional performance.</td><td>Supply chain management, antecedents, integration, and performance</td><td>[1] Amason, A.C.

Focusing on the case of Vietnam Environment Protection Fund, we found that the instrument of state financial transfers including grants, soft loans, accelerated depreciation allowances, tax incentives, and subsidies have propensity for lack of effectiveness due to creating insufficient incentives and increasing burden on the State budget. The application of market-based instruments is more effective but in Vietnam the rate of this figure is only 1% for market-based instruments while most of its budget (99%) spends on soft loans projects. Therefore, the recommendations are proposed to reduce the instruments of state financial transfers and foster use of market-based instruments in environmental protection activities for the sustainable development.</td><td>State financial transfers, environment protection, market-based instruments, market-based polices, Vietnam</td><td>[1] Bernstein, J.D.

However, such studies generally suggest that the introduction of IFRS guarantees consistency and compliance in practice. Given that goodwill impairment testing under IFRS presents a technically challenging task (Hoogendoorn, 2006; Wines et al., 2007) that can materially impact the determination of economic profit, this study focuses on assessing the compliance quality of a large sample of Hong Kong listed firms that are mature IFRS adopters. By examining the detailed disclosures made by 264 large listed firms in 2007, three years after Hong Kong’s implementation of IFRS, an alarmingly high rate of non compliance with HKAS 36 still exists among these goodwill-intensive firms, casting doubts over the hypothesis that lax compliance is a characteristic associated solely with early adoption.</td><td>Goodwill, impairment, financial reporting standard, HKAS 36, Hong Kong</td><td>[1] Anantharaman, D.

In fact, the State bank of Vietnam has shown the International Monetary Fund its willingness to adopt this framework over the past 5 years  since 2005. In order to prepare for successfully adopting this framework and reaching price stability, firstly, and most importantly, the central bank needs to have a certain degree of independence. In fact, the negative relationship between the degree of central bank independence (CBI) and inflation is found in both industrialised countries and developing countries. In this study, legal central bank independence indices are calculated for Vietnam according to the newest and most popular methods of Grilli, Masciandaro, and Tabellini (1991) and Cukierman (1992). We compare and conclude that the central bank independence index of Vietnam is lower than that of other emerging countries. In these countries, like Vietnam, the Central bank is a member of Government.  Suggestions for the State bank of Vietnam in terms of improvements in lending regulations to government, thus, are provided.</td><td>Central bank independence, inflation targeting, legal institution, monetary policy, Vietnam</td><td>[1] Alamsyah, H., and Joseph, C., and Agung, J., and Zulverdy, D.

In comparison with most of the existing literature that mainly considers self-employment in general, this study refers to two groups of young self-employed people: (i) self-employers who work for themselves (not employers), and (ii) business managers/owners (employers), and points out the factors that have quite different impacts on these groups. The balanced panel dataset during the period 2006-2009 that corresponds to a strong process of global economic integration in Vietnam is used. Applying fixed and random effects models, the results imply that self-employment is a temporary option for young people when the risk of unemployment and under-employment is high. In addition, the low labor market competitiveness of young people that is mainly due to limited skills and qualifications is the main reason that makes young people engage in the self-employment sector. There was also evidence that regional development factors have promoted local youth entrepreneurship in Vietnam.</td><td>Self-employment, youth entrepreneurship, youth business participation, “Push- Pull theories”</td><td>[1] Acs, Z.

Lessons and Applicability in Vietnam</td><td>Nuclear Science and Technology</td><td>15</td><td>3</td><td>2013</td><td>en</td><td>Export growth is now seen by most governments as a key to economic growth and recent growth in emerging East Asia has been export led. The so-called Export Credit Agencies (ECAs) played a critical role in cushioning the downturn in cross border trade to emerging market economies during the global economic and financial crisis that hit in the fall of 2008. This crisis is considered by many to be one of the greatest economic challenges since the Great Depression of the 1930s. In addition to facilitating cross border trade during times of crisis ECAs can also help companies in emerging countries access long term funding and potentially at a lower interest rate than they could locally. This can help companies modernize their processing lines, especially those engaged in capital intensive activities, and enable emerging economies in transition to increase the value added of their industries and boost export earnings. This article discusses the role of ECAs in facilitating cross border trade to emerging markets as well as the economic rationale for the existence of such agencies. It also demonstrates how selected risk mitigation instruments of ECAs, namely: (i) buyer credit guarantee, (ii) supplier credit guarantees and (iii) export loans have been applied in practice. Finally, real cases are presented that highlight how companies have used the service of ECAs, for example, to obtain better terms, including larger loan allocation, and longer term loans at lower interest rates. </td><td>Cross border trade, emerging markets, financial crisis, export credit agencies (ECAs), commercial and non-commercial risks, and risk mitigation instruments</td><td>[1] Ascari, R.

The results show that any cash transfer programs could have reduced poverty for older people. The paper also shows that cash transfer would help reduce expenditure inequality as the Gini coefficients for the whole population as well as for older people at different age thresholds would reduce when cash transfer was introduced. With a special focus on expansion of the current cash transfer program to older Vietnamese people, the paper provides scenario-based micro-simulation results for costs and poverty rate reduction for different programs covering groups of older people at different ages, and the results show that the total cost would be in line with that in many other developing countries.</td><td>Aging, cash transfer, micro-simulation, poverty, Vietnam</td><td>[1] Dam Huu Dac, Pham Do Nhat Tan, Nguyen Tiep, Nguyen Hai Huu, Nguyen Thi Thu Huong, Tran Huu Trung, Tran Thi Tuyet, and Vu Van Thoai (2010), Social Welfare Policies and the Development of Social Services for the Elderly under Socialist-oriented Market Economy (in Vietnamese), MoLISA, Hanoi.<br />[2] Evans, M., Giang, T.

Therefore formation of a South Asian Free Trade Area (SAFTA) was proposed with an aim of extending intraregional trade that came into force in 2006. SAFTA in terms of population is the largest of any economic bloc but has appeared as a least integrated bloc while taking trade among members into account, which is only 6.2% of total trade. To increase trade the list of commodities under sensitive categories has been revised in 2012. Taking an  interpretivist approach this study reports that Bangladesh will be one of the significant beneficiaries of SAFTA as it will help reduce the longstanding trade deficit with India, create a large regional market and support its key industries such as; Readymade Garments (RMG) and  pharmaceuticals to enhance competitiveness. Optimizing the benefits, however, may not be accomplished if nontariff barriers such as; mind-set, political tensions and bilateral conflicting issues are not dealt with extreme care beside tariff barriers.</td><td>Free Trade Area, regional integration, SAARC, SAFTA</td><td>[1] Akanda, A.

Empirical findings have shown that this heuristic has significant economic consequences for the efficiency of the financial market of Vietnam. Specifically, we investigate the existence of anchoring and adjustment bias when stock analysts forecast future earnings of a firm by examining 661 analysts’ reports forecasting prices in Vietnam from 2009 - 2012. In addition, we find that anchoring and adjustment bias appears to have considerable influence over both male and female analysts. With the multi-variable regression model, we find out the effects of anchoring and adjustment bias on different group of analysts as well as the time horizon.</td><td>Anchoring and adjustment bias, analysts’ earnings forecasts, forecasting error, behavioral finance</td><td>[1] Amir, E., & Ganzach, Y.

It proposes an approach for measuring the quality of the higher education service provided by universities in Vietnam. Firstly, an exploratory study was conducted. Then, the set of items which were generated became the subject of a questionnaire that was then administered to 675 students of a Vietnamese university to determine the dimensions of higher education service quality in this context. The obtained results permit us to appropriate a measurement scale which is slightly different from the SERVQUAL scale widely known as the standard for measuring service quality. The results also show that tangible elements, responsiveness and assurance seem to be three specific dimensions of the higher education service of Vietnamese universities.</td><td>Higher education, service quality, SERVQUAL, SERVPERF, Vietnam</td><td>[1] Anderson,J. and Gerbing, W., (1988), ‘Structural equation modelling in practice: A review and recom-mended two stage approach’, Psychological Bulletin, Vol. 27, Issue 1, pp. 5-24.<br />[2] Babakus, E and Boller, G.W., (1992), ‘An empirical assessment of the SERVQUAL scale’, Journal of business research, Vol.24, pp. 253-268.<br />[3] Bardin.

Two econometric models are conducted, the first one is a panel data model, used to examine the determinants of household saving; and the second one is a multinomial logit model used to investigate how a household chooses the way to save. Both models are based on the life cycle theory of saving and the permanent income hypothesis. We find that the household head’s age, education and gender are closely related to their saving behavior. And the impact of these variables takes different patterns between the two models. The results are useful for further research in forecasting household savings as well as in micro finance to find a better way of serving people who live in rural areas.</td><td>Demographics, saving behavior, households, rural areas, Vietnam</td><td>[1] Banerjee.

A sample of 812 Vietnamese visitors participated in this study. Structural equation modeling (SEM) was applied in order to test the relationship between the constructs, and to evaluate their reliability and the validity. As expected, the findings highlight the importance of incorporating the roles of variety-seeking in the satisfaction - destination intentional loyalty relationship. Specifically, variety-seeking is found to negatively moderate the direct effect of the visitor satisfaction-loyalty relationship.</td><td>Variety seeking, satisfaction, destination, intentional loyalty, WOM (Word of Mouth)</td><td>[1] Aiken, L.S and West, S.G (1991), ‘Multiple Regression: Testing and Interpreting Interactions, Sage’, Thousand Oaks, CA.<br />[2] Anderson, J.C and Gerbing, D.W (1988), ‘Structural equation modeling in practice: A review and recommended two-step approach’, Psychological Bulletin, Vol 103 no.3, pp. 411-423.<br />[3] Anderson, R.

Although the F-PEC scale, which comprises three subscales for power, experience and culture dimensions of family influence, has been validated in the literature, application of the scale in an Asian context, like Vietnam, may face challenges due to context differences. The study modified the original scale based on qualitative findings from five interviews with entrepreneurs and comments on the scale from business scholars. Data from a survey of 143 entrepreneurs were used for EFA, resulting in four factors. And CFA proves fitness of the measurement model of the four-factor structure to the data, in which two dimensions regarding the cultural aspect were confirmed.</td><td>Family business, small business, F-PEC scale</td><td>[1] Astrachan, J.

However, the rapid growth of the leather industry causes considerable pollution, which poses increased risks to the environment and human health. A number of policies have been introduced by the government of Vietnam to mitigate the environmental pollution from the tanning industry. They include requirements for tanneries to (i) submit environmental impact assessment reports, (ii) install wastewater treatment systems, and (iii) pay wastewater fees. However, many tanneries in Vietnam did not comply with these regulations. This study aimed at investigating the compliance of Vietnam’s tanneries with environmental regulations and to explore policy recommendations for improving their compliance based on a survey of 54 tanneries in Hanoi, Quangnam and Hochiminh city. The results showed that medium-sized and large tanneries responded positively to environmental regulations while none of the small household tanneries surveyed were found to comply. The main reasons for the latter’s non-compliance were found to be the lack of technical and financial capacity. Nonetheless, the compliance rate of tanneries in general was found to be much higher than that of other industrial sectors in Vietnam. Inspections, production capacity, location of firms, and type of tannery were found to be significant factors affecting compliance. Raising the penalties for non-compliance, increasing monitoring activities to detect offenders, and employing a multi-stakeholder and collective action approach were seen as possible strategies to bring about the greening of the tanning industry.</td><td>Leather tanning industry, environmental regulations, compliance, Vietnam</td><td>[1] ADB [Asian Development Bank] (2008), Asian Development Outlook 2008, Manila, Philippines.<br />[2] Alexander, K.T.W, D.R.

However, the term supplier visibility has been underdeveloped. For better future studies and application of the concept, we need to clarify it theoretically and practically. This paper endeavors to fill in the gap by providing a conceptualization of supplier visibility which is built on extant theories. Specifically, our literature review on this concept has shown that the term has usually been used interchangeably with other concepts such as information sharing. We stress, however, that to be qualified for supplier visibility, the concept needs to take information sharing as a prerequisite, but goes beyond it and requires the efficacy conditions. Moreover, as suggested by extant theories, supplier visibility may be multi-dimensional. Thus, we conceptualize supplier visibility as the degree to which a focal buying firm is able to access timely, accurate, and relevant information about its supplier’s operational and strategic issues. To illustrate the working of the concept in practice, a case study in the automotive industry contrasting the approaches used by the U.S. and Japanese manufacturers is presented. Directions are also recommended for future studies.</td><td>Visibility, transparency, relational rent, resource-based view, supply chain management</td><td>[1] Amit, R. and P. J. H.

The selection of discount rates is believed to be an important key factor that affects the outcome of impairment assessment, especially when using the method of value in use. This study objectively examines the Singapore listed firm’s selection of discount rates disclosed, and then tests and compares the variation between discount rates disclosed by firms for the goodwill impairment testing with independently generated estimates of firm specific risk adjusted discount rates for multi year samples of 2007, 2006 and 2005.     In order to achieve  the objective of this study, the Capital Asset Pricing Model (CAPM) is chosen because it describes the relationship between risk and expected return and that is used in the pricing of risky securities. For the purposes of this paper, the final research sample consists of 142, 127 and 86 firms that employed the value in use method in goodwill impairment testing and defined only a single discount rate in 2007, 2006 and 2005 respectively. The results show most of the firms understated their discount rates for 2005, while in 2006 and 2007 some firms overstated their discount rate when compared with an independently estimated risk adjusted discount rate. The results also indicate that the Singapore listed firms have difficulties in the discount rates disclosure which may in turn limit the decision usefulness of their financial disclosures by potentially diluting the robustness of the impairment testing.</td><td>Discount rate selection, goodwill accounting, impairment testing, FRS 36.</td><td>[1] Bancel, F., & Mittoo, U.

It has been perceived that through this measure the over-concentration of economic activity would be controlled and dispersed. Development of rural industrialization has passed through three different phases: i) the period of promoting rural cottage-type industries (1960-80); ii) the period of rural industrial park establishment; and iii) a stagnation period after the early 1990s. Throughout the overall period government policy changed from an individual project-oriented approach to a diversified and comprehensive policy program. The policy programs, such as the development of rural industrial parks, off-farm income source development and vocational training programs for farm youths, have helped in promoting rural industrialization.    On the other hand, policy programs promoting rural out-migration and unbalanced regional development policy have impacted negatively on rural industrialization. Presently one of the serious policy issues facing rural industries is how to secure a young labor force and how to promote rural entrepreneurship. In addition, rural development efforts by local government and authorities are necessary in order to increase investment from urban-based entrepreneur firms.</td><td>Rural industrialization, farm household, off-farm income, rural development, rural industrial park, rural entrepreneurship.</td><td>[1] Choe, Sang-Chul and Chong-Kee Kim (1986), ‘Rural Industry Policy in Korea: Past Experiences and New Approach’, In Yang-Boo Choe and Fu-Cohen Lo, eds.

There are two opposite schools of thought in the literature on rural credit policies in developing countries. One is the conventional supply-side (government-led) approach while the other is called “a new paradigm” that emphasizes the importance of the viability of financial providers and the well functioning of rural credit markets. Conventional theories of rural finance contend that rural finance in low-income countries is generally accompanied by many failures. Contrary to these theories, rural finance in Vietnam does not encounter the above-mentioned failures so far.  Up to the present time, it is progressing well. Using a supply-side approach, methodologically, this study reviews the development of the rural financial system in Vietnam. The significance of this study is to challenge the extreme view of dichotomizing between the old and the new credit paradigms. Analysis in this study contends that a rural financial market that, (1) is initiated and spurred by government; (2) operates principally under market mechanisms; and (3) is strongly supported by rural organizations (semi-formal/informal institutions) can progress stably and well. Therefore, the extremely dichotomizing approach must be avoided.</td><td>Rural finance, Vietnam, financial market.</td><td>[1] Adams, Dale. W.

To build up a sound and sustainable health insurance system towards this goal, we need to account for the effect of asymmetric information on the use of the health care services, namely moral hazards and adverse selection. This paper uses distinc- tive features of Vietnam's health insurance system to separately estimate the effect of each type. Our results show that the effect of asymmetric information is quite severe and prevalent for old people, and is insignificant for young people. The results can  be used for the construction of health insurance policies for Vietnam.</td><td>Asymmetric  information,  moral  hazard,  adverse  selection,  Health insurance, PSM</td><td>[1] Akerlof, George (1970), ‘The Market for “Lemons”: Quality Uncertainty and the Market Mechanism’, The Quarterly Journal of Economics, 1970; 84(3): 488-500.<br />[2] Barros PP, Machado M, Sanz-de-Galdeano A.

Demands for narrow money, broad money and board money in foreign currencies were estimated. The estimated results sug- gested that all demand functions are stable. They can be intermediate targets of the Bank of the Lao PDR. The substantial results point out: (i) there is an evidence of ample influence of exchange rates and interest rate on money balances in the Lao PDR; (ii) expected inflation indicates the effect of high inflation episodes on money balances, especially in terms of foreign currency, and (iii) the local currency, the Kip, is used predominantly for transaction purposes rather than foreign currencies</td><td>Demand for money, long-run relationship, narrow money, broad money, error correction model.</td><td>[1] Aghevli, B.B., et.al (1979), ‘Monetary Policy in Selected Asian Countries’, IMF Staff Papers, Vol. 26, pp.<br />[2] Asian Development Bank (ADB) Team (2012), ‘Lao PDR Bond Market Guide’, February 2012.<br />[3] Bahmani-Oskooee, M.. and Tanku, A.

In these countries, the governance of the CB is based on the three main principles of New Public Management (NPM) known as the three ‘pillars’, which includes: (i) central bank independence; (ii) central bank accountability, and (iii) central bank transparency. Among them, central bank independence is considered the key and pri- mary ‘pillar’. This implies that the reform of the central bank towards an independ- ent entity thereby could be seen as one of the most important elements of a public administration reform program in developing countries (LCDs), and Vietnam should not be an exception. The State Bank of Vietnam (SBV) – as the Vietnam’s Central Bank  –  has  been  operating  successfully  in  the  last  decades  and  has  contributed greatly  to  Vietnam’s  development.  However,  the  dependence  of  the  SBV  on  the Government has shown a number of weaknesses that should be overcome as soon as possible  in  the  next  stage  of  the  development  process,  especially  when  Vietnam becomes an official member of the World Trade Organization (WTO) in 2018. In this paper, three issues will be covered, including: (1) The independent central bank and  its positive impact on the development and stabilization of the economy as a theoret- ical framework for discussion on the need for and the way of the reform of the cen- tral  bank  in  developing  countries;  (2)   a  factual  analysis  of  the  SBV’s  problems resulting from its high dependence upon the government, as well as opportunities and challenges of  reforming the SBV towards an independent central bank; (3) rec- ommendations for solutions to ensure the success of  SBV reform in the future.</td><td>Central bank, central bank independence, financial system reform, public management reform, accountability, transparency, autonomy, State Bank of Vietnam.</td><td>[1] Caslstrom, CT. and Fuerst, TS.

The results show that financial development has a positive impact on reducing income inequality, which is consistent with the bulk of theoretical and empirical research. The results also confirms that financial development when it interacts with education has joint-effects on reducing income inequality. We also find no evidence supporting the Greenwood-Jovanovic hypothesis of an inverted U-shaped relationship between the financial sector of development and inequality.</td><td>Financial development, income inequality, Vietnam</td><td>[1] Ang, J.B.

We conducted in-depth interviews with twenty-six bankers in Vietnam and the U.S. Our results suggest that the development of market institutions has  a  strong  influence  on  managers’ frequency  use  of  rational  versus  subjective decision making approaches. In developed countries, the presence of a large data base  and  a  reliable  legal  system  facilitates  bankers’ choice  of  rational  decision making. In the absence of effective market institutions, bankers have no choice but  to rely extensively on personal heuristics and biases to make loan decisions. In this situation, heuristics and biases were used intentionally and consciously in decision making process. Two strategies to minimize bias errors – controlling and learning strategies – were used extensively by Vietnamese bankers.</td><td>Decision making, bank financing, Vietnam</td><td>[1] Berger, A.

Corporate governance is considered to be one of the most critical factors influenc- ing firm performance and in banking sector it is particularly important as banks play  a  specific  role  in  the  economic  system  through  the  way  it  facilitates  capital allocation and help minimize risk for businesses.      This paper is aimed at filling the gap by presenting the issue of bank corporate governance in terms of both theoretical framework and empirical study. In the the- oretical framework, the research provides readers with the fundamental aspects of corporate governance in general and bank corporate governance in particular with two popular frameworks. The empirical study presents a selection of banks for the sample and uses econometric models to test the effect of several corporate gover- nance variables on bank performance. From the result of the reseach, it has been found out that the number of members in Board of Director and the ratio of Capital Adequacy have great influence on the performance of  the Vietnamese commercial banks.</td><td>Bank  performance,  board  size,  capital  adequacy  ratio,  corporate governance, board composition.</td><td>[1] Adams, R.B. and Mehran, H.

Women – the important population force – participate in most  economic-social activities and are  the “fire-keeper” of any family as the cell for society.  Women’s roles refects the important achievements in society advance- ment  and  gender  equality.  In  this  paper,  we  summarize  some  findings  from  our research with UN Women on the impact of macroeconomic reform on women roles over 10 years, such as (i) the overall economic conditions and living standards have been  much  more  improved,  which  directly  benefit   women  and  their  families  (ii) women in Vietnam have generally been treated equally to men in almost all aspects; (iii) women capacities have been improved over time, thanks to access to education and resources; (iv) the Women’s Union plays an important role in ensuring the ben- eficiaries and activities of women in general. However, several issues created the challenges for development of women in the next period, such as (i) less spending proportion  for  education  and  health;  (ii)  women  still  have  to  face  the  burden  of houseworkss,  particularly  childcare  and  household  farmings;  (iii)  women  lag behind men in their participation in industrial employment and are concentrated in agriculture and services. The recommendations for related stakeholders are settled for   more gender equality in terms of quality in the future. It is important for sus- tainable development which  results  from macroeconomic reform.</td><td>Women’s role, women’s position, macroeconomic reform, Vietnam</td><td>[1] Demirguc K., Asli, and Levine R., (1996a), ‘Stock Markets, Corporate Finance and Economic Growth: An Overview’, The World Bank Economic Review 10 (2), pp. 223-239.<br />[2] Ministry of Labour-invalids and Social affairs, European Union- ILO (2009), Vietnam Employment Trends 2009.<br />[3] Melanie Beresford (1997), Impact of macroeconomic reform on women in Vietnam. <br />[4] GSO Vietnam(2009-2010), Report Labour force at 15 years of age and above by sex and residence. <br />[5] GSO Vietnam (2004-2006-2008), Summary results of the Vietnam household living standard survey. <br />[6] ILO (2009), KIML6 Ministry of Labour-invalids and Social affairs, Data of the survay of Laobour and employment Vietnam 1995-2007. <br />[7] CSEDPF (2010), Informal employment in vietnam identification – coverage of policy and issues neces- sary to study. <br />[8] Decision No. 2351/QD-TTg of December 24, 2010, approving the 2011-2020 national strategy for gender equality</td><td>http://jed.edu.vn//back-issue/volume-14-number-2-august-2012/position-change-of-vietnamese-women-in-macrocell-economic-policy-reform-episode-comparative-analysis-of-secondary-data.372512.aspx</td><td></td><td>Ngo Van Thu;Nationnal Economics University, Vietnam;thunvtkt@neu.edu.vn<br />Le Thanh Tam;Nationnal Economics University, Vietnam;tamlt@neu.edu.vn<br />Pham Thi Nga;Nationnal Economics University, Vietnam<br />Nguyen Thuy Trang;Nationnal Economics University, Vietnam</td></tr><tr valign="top"><td>Disclosure Quality of Goodwill  Impairment Testing: A Disclosure Index</td><td>Nuclear Science and Technology</td><td>14</td><td>1</td><td>2012</td><td>en</td><td>This study sets out to offer proof of several important questions relating to the quality  of  information  disclosed  on  goodwill  impairment  process  under  the  new requirements of FRS 36. This study investigates the compliance level and disclosure quality of FRS 36 by top 20 of Singaporean listed firms in SGX at 2007 based on their market capitalization. In order to achieve the objective of this study, the weight-  ed index is chosen because this index is able to differentiate the quality and impor- tance of each mandatory disclosure under FRS 36.      The  weighted  index  was  developed  by  constructing  a  disclosure  scoring  sheet, obtaining annual reports of 20 sampled Singapore firms for particular year, complet- ing scoring sheet for each firms by assigned weighted for the disclosure items and calculating disclosure weighted index. The weighted index was analyzed to examine the firm’s compliance with the FRS 36 disclosure requirements. The results of this study revealed that 18 out of 20 (90%) firms in Singapore failed to comply with the most basic elements of the FRS 36 pertaining to goodwill impairment testing espe- cially in allocating goodwill into the CGUs and key assumptions used in determin- ing the recoverable amount of CGU assets.</td><td>Impairment testing, FRS 36, Weighted Index, Singapore.</td><td>[1] AICPA.

The study described the process of the BSC system implemented a Vietnam-based international audit firm, and used Kasurinen (2002)’s model of barriers to account- ing  change  to  analyse  barriers  that  caused  the  system  ineffective.  The  study revealed  that  despite  a  very  sound  implementation  process,  several  issues  were found. They are low awareness of the system among staff and seniors, and the fail- ure to use the system to align the firm’s strategy with individuals’ development plan. The reasons for these issues were classified into confusers, frustrators and delay- ers. Confusers were the lack of understanding about the system, weak sponsorship process from seniors and managers, and different views on the use of the system among managers. Frustrators were the preference for indirect communication and routine of using personal relationship in allocating staff into jobs. These were found  to  be  culture-related  and  task-related  barriers.  Delaying  factors  were  the  inade- quate education and training process, the human resource constraint, and the gap between intended and actual uses of a component in the BSC system. The study sug- gests that the inadequate of training for staff about the system seems to be the main cause of all issues; therefore, a better focus on training for staff may help to improve the effectiveness of the system.</td><td>Balanced  Scorecard,  barriers,  knowledge-based  firms,  performance measurement, Vietnam</td><td>[1] Argyris, C. and Kaplan, R.

Research hypotheses have been established and verified over a sample  of 6603 foreign firms who made investments in Vietnam during the period from 1988  to  2010.  The  results  of  the  study  were  in  agreement  with  the  eclectic  model (Dunning, 1980, 1995). We found the significant impact of almost of components of OLI advantages, in the exception of MNEs’ size and cultural distance. The results indicate that: “O” advantages such as (experience and asset specificity) are posi- tively associated with MNEs’ WOS choice, so negatively its IJV choice; “L” advan- tages such as investment risk, GDP growth and “I” advantages such as currency risk influence positively the MNEs’ IJV choice; so negatively its WOS choice.</td><td>Entry modes, international joint ventures, wholly owned subsidiaries, FDI, eclectic model, Vietnam</td><td>[1] Agarwal S, Ramaswami SN.

Drawing from the previous literature  in learning through alliances, this research presents and tests a theoretical model linking IJV learning, its antecedents and consequence. Several organizational prac- tices in the ventures appear as strong predictors of learning. Specifically, learning was associated with the venture’s allocation of resources to training and level of joint participation, as well as the frequency of interaction between foreign and local ven- ture employees. IJV learning was significantly related to the venture performance. Further, the ventures’ investment in learning had a significant impact on perform- ance that was not simply a function of knowledge learnt from the foreign partner.</td><td>International joint ventures (IJVs), learning, performance</td><td>[1] Argyris, C. and D.

In   India,   Non- Governmental Organization (NGO) led micro credit is proved as an effective and financially viable alternative to address rural poverty through the provision of cred-  it without collateral, unleashing human creativity and endeavor of the poor people. Micro finance institutions are operating through banks linkage program aimed at providing  a  cost  effective  mechanism  for  providing  financial  services  to  the  ‘unreached poor’. Banks lend micro-credit through Self-Help Groups (SHGs) and to local Micro-Finance Institutions (MFIs) based on the philosophy of peer pressure and group savings as collateral substitute.  In India, the micro-Finance concept has been successful in not only designing financial products meeting needs of the rural poor, but also in strengthening collective self-help capacities of the poor at the local level, leading to their empowerment.  At macro level, the self help group is a useful instrument  for  savings  mobilization  and  enhancing  access  to  credit  for  the  rural, unreached poor for their productive investment.  In this paper an attempt has been made  to  describe  how  micro  credit  is  effective  and  financial  viable  method  of addressing sustainable rural development through provision of micro credit to rural poor for productive activities.</td><td>Empowerment, micro finance, micro credit, poverty alleviation, self help group, sustainable development</td><td>[1] Chavan, P, & Ramakumar, R.

We demonstrate that less pollution lowers healthcare spending, and shows the existence of an inverted U-shaped relationship between the pollution tax and (i) the level of health; (ii) consumption; and (iii) welfare.

International trade and economic growth were related during the reform periods. This paper examines the impact of trade policy reform on social welfare, inequality, and poverty in Lao PDR from 1997-2003. In addition, we investigated the effect of price changes under AFTA commitments by the  pass-through approach between 2005 and 2007. We also analyzed the social welfare and inequality measurement indices which were based on the Atkinson-(1970) and Sen (1973) approaches by using Lao Expenditure Consumption Survey data. We found that during trade liberalization process could increase households’ social welfare by 196,529 LAK and inequality declined by 10 percent. Moreover, the import commodity prices change under AFTA commitments decreased significantly in 2007 especially consumption goods and investment capital goods. Those effects seem to  benefit poor households and farmers who could then purchase lower imported commodity prices and higher quality investment capital goods.</td><td>The Impact of Trade Policy Reform on Social Welfare,  Inequality and Poverty: The case of Lao PDR</td><td>[1] Andersson, M., Engvall, A., and Kokko, A.

This research attempts to bridge this gap by exploring the customer-based brand equity concept from the retailers’ perspective. The study was conducted in the context of the Vietnamese independent retail grocery sector. This context was chosen on the basis that there has been limited research conducted on branding in the Vietnamese context and due to the prominence of the independent grocery sector in the retail industry of Viet Nam. By using AMOS 16 and SPSS 16.0 software, the results of the study indicate that brand equity plays an important role in the retailing context, and it comprises three dimensions - brand association, brand trust and brand loyalty. As the result of a strong brand, retailers commit to a long-term business relationship with the brand’s manufacturer. Two of these three dimensions of retailer-based brand equity, (brand association and brand trust) are positively and significantly related to the brand’s performance at the retail outlet. Manufacturer support, including advertising, sales promotion and trade promotions has been confirmed by this study to be an antecedent of retailer-based brand equity, brand performance and customer perceived value as well.</td><td>Brand equity, brand association, brand trust, brand loyalty, customer value, manufacturer support, brand performance.</td><td>[1]	Aaker, D.

The  forecasts  result  from  simulation  scenarios  run  on  an  Applied  General  Equilibrium  (AGE)  model  for  the  Vietnamese  economy,  using  General  Equilibrium  Modeling Software (GEMPACK).      Depending on the different assumptions about factors’ mobility, the numerical results of simulations show a relatively large short-run decline in the GDP growth rate, and smaller declines in the long run. In general, following the model results it seems difficult to expect that application of the EPT would directly bring positive economic effects2. The benefits of  the EPT should be drawn from that the natural environment is improved and therefore the quality of life would be better. The simulation results also emphasize the necessity of gov- ernment accompanying policies and measures, such as use/ redistribute  the EPT revenues  in different programs aiming to improve the natural environment and to assist the strong-  ly  energy-  dependent  industries,  to  help  the  seriously  suffering  households.  Our  further research plan is precisely to run some model simulations on possible impacts of such kind  of macro policies.</td><td>Environment  protection  tax,  general  equilibrium  model,  Vietnamese economy, macro-  and  micro –simulations, Gempack</td><td>[1] Abbott, P., J.

Using various analytical tools, the empiri- cal findings are established as follows. First, Vietnam’s exports are dominated by unskilled labor and agricultural resource intensive products. Second, between 2001 and 2009, there has been an overall improvement in Vietnam’s RCA indices. Third, the pattern of Vietnam’s revealed comparative advantage has converged. Fourth, there is a relatively low degree of mobility  among  industries,  which  initially  have  no  comparative  advantages  and  those industries, which initially enjoy high comparative advantages, while there is a moderate mobility in the pattern of trade for those industries, which initially have weak comparative advantage  and  those  industries,  which  initially  have  medium  comparative  advantages. Finally, there is a low degree of concentration in Vietnam’s exports, and these export pat- terns are more or less moving toward diversification. Measures to further liberalize trade policy, increase human capital formation and facilitate technological transfer are remedies for Vietnam to diversify the country’s export structures and move into human capital and technology intensive exports</td><td>Revealed comparative advantage, export specialization, galtonian regression, transition probability matrix, mobility indices, Gini-Hirschman index, Vietnam.</td><td>[1] Amador, J., Cabral, S., and Maria, J.R. 2007, ‘Relative Export Structures and Vertical Specialization:a Simple Cross-country Index,’ Banco de Portugal Working Paper 2007-1, Lisbon.<br />[2] Balassa, B. 1965, ‘Trade Liberalization and Revealed Comparative Advantage,’ The Manchester School of Economic and Social Studies 33: 99-124.<br />[3] Balassa, B. 1977, ‘Revealed Comparative Advantage Revisited: An Analysis of Relative ExportShares of the Industrial Countries, 1953-1971,’ The Manchester School of Economic & Social Studies 45 (4): 327-344.<br />[4] Balassa, B. 1986, ‘Comparative Advantage in Manufactured Goods: A Reappraisal,’The Review of Economics and Statistics 68 (2): 315-319.<br />[5] Balassa, B. and Bauwens, L. 1987, ‘Intra-industry Specialization in a Multi-Country and MultiIndustry Framework,’ The Economic Journal 97: 923-939.<br />[6] Bojnec, S. and Ferto, I. 2008, ‘European Enlargement and Agro-Food Trade’, Canadian Journal of Agricultural Economics 56: 563-579.<br />[7] Bowen, H.

The Vietnam rural financial sector has been growing and making significant contribution to  its rural development by a rapid expansion of outreach and available fund sources. However, there have been remaining problems that are very likely to hinder the sector from its further development. Such problems are: (1) there is a lack of responsive and adequate financial services in rural areas; (2) a significant number of the poor households still do not have access to any microfinance services, to name a few. Thus, this paper is intented to focus on two main issues. The first is to analyze the causes of such problems, and the second is to pro- vide  recommendations  that  are  strongly  expected  to  overcome  such  problems  to  enhance Vietnam rural development in the new decade with the Development Millenium Goal.</td><td>Credit, microfinancial institutions (MFIs), poverty reduction, rural finance, sav- ings.</td><td>[1] ADB 2010, Microfinance Assessment of ADB TA-7499-VIE : Developing Microfinance Sector in Vietnam, Hanoi.<br />[2] ADB 2010, ‘Financial Sector Development, Economic Growth, and Poverty Reduction: A Literature Review’, ADB Economics Working Paper Series No. 173.

The current study was carried out by employing questionnaire survey method. A sample of 181 respondents participated in the study. Based on previous studies, we selected four attributes which compose COs. These are (1) reputation (well-known/not well-known), (2) types of activities (wildlife charity/environmental charity/humanitarian charity), (3) benefits offered to donors (invitations to special charity gala and events/fiscal incentives/high personal recognition), and transparency (high/low). The findings of the study are as follows: (1) the most important attribute is transparency, followed by the types of activities, and benefits offered to donors. The reputation of COs turns out to be least important, (2) high transparency and COs activities of humanitarian charity have the biggest impact on the intention of donating. Managerial implications, limitations and direction for future research are discussed.</td><td>Charitable organization;Conjoint analysis;Multi Correspondence Analysis; Reputation; Rewards and benefits offered;Transparency;Types of activities</td><td>[1] Andreoni, J., & Scholz, J.

Furthermore, the study would like to discover if these effects are different in different cultures. The author applied qualitative method, and the data were collected through 15 semi-structured interviews (including 7 cases conducted in Finland and 8 cases interviewed in Vietnam). Participants chosen for the research were knowledgeable employees working in Vietnamese or Finnish original enterprises. Four features of a performance appraisal system, which are goal setting, supervisor - subordinate relationship, rewards linked with performance result and fairness issue are argued based on literature review. From empirical studies, a variety of findings is identified supporting and supplementing for existing theories. One of those is the emphasis of self-development based performance appraisal in Finland and the rewarding based one in Vietnam. The performance appraisal system has weak impact on Finnish employees’ loyalty; while it does influence Vietnamese individual intention to leave the job. The findings also illustrate that Finnish staff take clear goal setting and fairness as prerequisite features of a performance appraisal; Vietnamese employees, in contrast, view the relationship with<br />supervisors and rewards received as more significant criteria. This study provides<br />suggestions of retaining talents for managerial practices. Findings of the research could<br />assist international managers to concentrate on features which strongly affect the employees’<br />satisfaction and loyalty when they design and implement performance appraisal system in<br />different locations.</td><td>Employee retention;Fairness issue;Goals setting; Performance appraisal;Relationship with supervisor;Rewards.</td><td>[1] Chiang, F.

Nguồn gen thuộc một số dòng bơ đã qua chọn lọc để canh tác được thu thập từ một số nơi trong địa bàn tỉnh Lâm Đồng để phân tích đa dạng di truyền và nhận dạng giống. Đặc điểm sơ bộ về hình thái quả và năng suất của 11 dòng bơ tiềm năng đã được ghi nhận để hỗ trợ cho cơ sở dữ liệu nhận dạng dòng. Với đặc trưng nhận dạng DNA thu nhận được với 10 mồi ISSR, chúng tôi thu được tổng số 125 band điện di trên gel để tiến hành phân tích đa dạng di truyền tập hợp 11 mẫu khảo sát đại diện cho 11 dòng trên, kết quả cho thấy: tập hợp mẫu có mức dị hợp trông đợi (chỉ số đa dạng gene) đạt He = h = 0,3072, chỉ số Shannon đạt: I = 0,4608, tỷ lệ band đa hình: PPB = 91,84%. Cũng sử dụng 10 mồi ISSR như trên, từ đặc trưng nhận dạng DNA của 18 mẫu đại diện cho 6 dòng bơ tiềm năng (mỗi dòng 3 mẫu), dựa trên sự xuất hiện hay thiếu vắng các band đặc trưng đã xác lập được 9 chỉ thị phân tử đơn và 25 chỉ thị phân tử kép để nhận dạng 06 dòng bơ này. Những kết quả bước đầu thu được cung cấp những dữ liệu cần thiết phục vụ cho công tác chọn tạo, phát triển giống bơ nói chung và xác định chủng loại giống với 6 dòng bơ tiềm năng.</td><td>Chỉ số Shannon;Chỉ thị phân tử;ISSR;Mức độ dị hợp trông đợi</td><td>[1] Ahmad, M.

The obtained eight equivalent circuits can realize all five standard filter functions namely lowpass, bandpass, highpass, notch and allpass employing only two active elements. The obtained circuits offer the following advantages: five inputs and two outputs, simple circuit configuration, orthogonal controllability between pole frequency and quality factor, and low active and passive sensitivities. The workability of some synthesized filters is verified by HSPICE simulations to demonstrate the usefulness of the proposed method.</td><td>Nodal admittance matrix expansion;Nullor-mirror element;Universal biquadratic filter;Voltage-mode</td><td>[1] Chen, H.

This paper presents an application of the DBSCAN clustering algorithm to classify Vietnamese words from a large corpus. The features used to characterize each word are naturally defined by the context of that word in a sentence.

To minimize these false alerts, it is necessary to develop a tool which helps pen-tester verify alerts manually or automatically with cross-checking results collected from many pen-test tools. We name this tool PAT (Pen-Test Assistance Tool). PAT is able to save experiences from previous successful checking for future check. PAT also can check vulnerabilities automatically based on report of pen-test tools and warn website errors to web-masters automatically via email.

In this paper, an improved bit allocation algorithm is proposed at the frame level for the emerging Scalable High-efficiency Video Coding (SHVC) standard. At the spatial base and enhancement layers, the bit budget is derived jointly from the hierarchical level and the visual complexity of the current frame, where the latter is measured by the inter-layer predicted MAD (Mean Absolute Difference) to allocate the bit budget of each frame. Experimental results show that the proposed method achieves more accurate bitrates with higher visual quality in the average PSNR up to 1.40dB, and controls buffer occupancy more satisfactorily, as compared with the-stateof-the-art approaches in the literature..</td><td>Bit Allocation; Mean Absolute Difference (MAD); Rate Control; Scalable High-efficiency Video Coding (SHVC); Scalable Video Coding (SVC).</td><td>[1] G.

At the receiver, the incoming signal is sampled with a sampling rate higher than chip rate before feeding to a correlator. This oversampling step aims to specifically determine delayed-signal components from fading multipath channels, which can be combined together by the correlator in order to increase the ratio of signal-to-noise at its output. In particular, the performance of the proposed receiver is investigated by means of a generalized flat Rayleigh fading channel which has one primary path (i.e., the path having the shortest transmission period) and multiple secondary paths (i.e., the other remaining paths with delays). Mathematical models in discrete-time domain for the conventional transmitter, generalized channel, and proposed receiver are proposed and analyzed. The theoretical bit-error-rate (BER) expression is first derived and then distribution histogram for the ratio of variable bit energy to noise power spectral density is computed. The BER performance is finally estimated by integrating the BER expression over all possible values of the histogram. Numerical simulations with specific parameters are carried out and then simulated performances are shown in comparison to estimated ones. Obtained results point out that the system performance is significantly improved when the number of secondary paths increases.</td><td>chaos;chaos-based communications;differential chaos-shift keying;dcsk;ﬂat fading channel;rayleigh distribution;ber performance</td><td>[1]F.

A great number of  research have been carried out to detect and remove shadows. However, these research works only focused on solving shadow problems in daytime traffic scenes. Up to now, far too little attention has been paid to the problem caused by vehicles’ reflections in rainy conditions. Unlike shadows in the daytime, which are homogeneous gray shades, reflection shadows are inhomogeneous regions of different colors. This characteristic makes reflections harder to detect and remove. Therefore, in this paper, we aim to develop a reflection detection and removal method from single images or video. Reflections are detected by determining a combination of L and B channels from LAB color space and H channel from HSV color space. The reflection removal method is performed by determining the optimal intensity of reflected areas so that they match with neighbor regions. The advantage of our method is that all reflected areas are removed without affecting vehicles’ textures or details.</td><td>hsv; lab; rainy conditions; reﬂection detection; reﬂection removal</td><td>[1] R.

The recovered trajectory can be considered as a dynamic feature of any static handwritten images. Capitalising on this temporal information can significantly increase the accuracy of the verification phase. Extraction of dynamic features from static handwritings remains a challenge due to the lack of temporal information as compared to the online methods. Previously, there are two typical approaches to recover the handwriting’s stroke. The first approach is based on the script’s skeleton. The skeletonisation method has highly computational efficiency whereas it often produces noisy artifacts and mismatches on the resulted skeleton. The second approach deals with the handwriting’s contour, crossing areas and overlaps using parametric representations of lines and thickness of strokes. This method can avoid the artifacts, but it requires complicated mathematical models and may lead to computational explosion. Our paper is based on the script’s extracted skeleton and provides an approach to processing static handwriting’s objects, including edges, vertices and loops, as the important aspects of any handwritten image. Our paper is also to provide analysing and classifying loops types and human’s natural writing behavior to improve the global construction of stroke order. Then, a detailed tracing algorithm on global stroke reconstruction is presented. The experimental results reveal the superiority of our method as compared with the existing ones.</td><td>handwriting recognition;trajectory recovery;off-line system, skeletonisation;stroke order recovery</td><td>[1] R.

Therefore, speech features of natural speech are generally smooth. However, over-smoothness causes &quot;muffleness&quot; and, hence, reduction in ability to identify emotions/expressions/styles in synthesized speech that can affect the perception of naturalness in synthesized speech. In the literature, statistical variances of static spectral features have been used as a measure of smoothness in synthesized speech but they are not sufficient enough. This paper proposes another measure of smoothness that can be efficiently applied to evaluate the smoothness of synthesized speech. Experiments showed that the proposed measure is reliable and efficient to measure the smoothness of different kinds of synthesized speech.</td><td>speech synthesis;speech quality; speech smoothness measure;global variance</td><td>[1] G.

The challenge is how to find the most wanted information from the Web with a minimum effort. This paper presents a novel ontology-based framework for searching the related web pages to a given term within a few given specific websites. With this framework, a web crawler first learns the content of web pages within the given websites, then the topic modeller finds the relations between web pages and topics via key words found on the web pages using the Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA) technique. After that, the ontology builder establishes an ontology which is a semantic network of web pages based on the topic model. Finally, a reasoner can find the related web pages to a given term by making use of the ontology. The framework and related modelling techniques have been verified using a few test websites and the results convince its superiority over the existing web search tools.</td><td>emantic network; ontology; topic models; search engine</td><td>[1] C.

However, since the deployment cost of a WSN is relatively large, one would want to make a logic model of a WSN and have the model verified beforehand to ensure that the WSN would work correctly and effectively once practically employed. Petri Net (PN) is very suitable to model a WSN, since PN strongly supports modeling concurrent and ad-hoc systems. However, verification of a PN-modeled system suffers from having to explore the huge state space of the system. In order to overcome it, in this paper we suggest a novel component-based approach to model and verify a PN-modeled WSN system. First of all, the original WSN system is divided into components, which can be further abstracted to reduce the model size. Moreover, when verifying the corresponding PN model produced from the abstracted WSN, we introduce a strategy of component-based firing, which can reduce the state space significantly. Compared to typical approach of PN-based verification, our method enjoys an impressive improvement of performance and resource consuming, as depicted in our experimental results.</td><td>wireless sensor networks; congestion detection; formal veriﬁcation; component-based petri net</td><td>[1] J.

In this paper, a Multiple-Symbol Differential Detection (MSDD) technique is proposed for DSM systems to mitigate the loss due to differential detection. The new scheme can greatly narrow the 3 dB performance gap by extending the observation interval for differential decoding. The technique uses maximum-likelihood sequence detection instead of traditional symbol-by-symbol detection, and is carried out on the slow, flat Rayleigh fading channel. A generalized decision metric is derived for an observation interval of arbitrary length. It is shown that for a moderate number of symbols, MSDD provides approximately 1.5 dB performance improvement over the conventional differential detection. In addition, a closed-form pairwise error probability and approximate bit error probability (BEP) are derived for multiple-symbol differential spatial modulation. Results show that the theoretical BEP matches well the simulated one. The BEP is shown to converge asymptotically with the number of symbols in the observation interval to that of the differential scheme with coherent detection.</td><td>mimo; differential spatial modulation; ultiple-symbol differential detection (msdd); decision metric; pairwise error probability (pep)</td><td>[1] R.

Among them, narrow band interference (NBI) might cause serious receiver performance degradation. Cancellation of NBI can be implemented by using notch filters (NF), which are controlled by two parameters: the notch frequency, which specifies the band center, and the notch bandwidth, which defines the spectrum area to be removed. The literature on the topic focuses on adapting the notch frequency, without estimating the filter bandwidth. This paper proposes a method able to determine both the notch parameters, optimizing the interference suppression. The performance analysis shows a good improvement by using the adaptive bandwidth notch filter.</td><td>satellite navigation;gnss;radio frequency interference (rfi); adaptive bandwidth notch filter; interference mitigation</td><td>[1] P.

By adding a virtual port – named Routing Modification port – into the conventional router architecture, the network router is able to route communication data flexibly whenever the target routing path is blocked, by unwanted defects or intently by a software programme to meet the requirements of applications. The proposed architecture has been modeled in SystemC/C++, simulated and verified within a 2D mesh 5×5 network platform. In normal communication mode, the static XY routing algorithm is used while the West-First algorithm with a proposed prohibited router surrounding technique is applied in reconfiguration mode. Experimental results are also reported to compare the performance of the network architecture in different operation modes as well as with other works.</td><td>network-on-chip; reconﬁguration;  high-level modeling</td><td>[1] L.

Localization and tracking are enhanced by improving the effect of the received signal strength (RSS) variation. First, we propose a modified particle filter (PF) that adjusts resampling parameters for the Kullback-Leibler distance (KLD)-resampling algorithm to ameliorate the effect of RSS variation by generating a sample set near the high-likelihood region. The key issue of this method is to use a resampling parameter lower bound for reducing both the root mean square error (RMSE) and the mean number of particles used. To determine this lower bound, an optimal algorithm is proposed based on the maximum RMSE between the proposed algorithm and the KLD-resampling algorithm or based on the maximum mean number of particles used of these algorithms. Finally, PFs based on KLD-sampling and KLD-resampling are proposed to minimize the efficient number of particles and to reduce the estimation error compared to traditional algorithms.</td><td>kld-resampling; kld-sampling; non-linear problems; sir</td><td>[1] A.

Based on transmission performance and power consumption, several low cost sub-GHz wireless transceivers are analyzed and compared, and consequently a suitable hardware is chosen. The associated network protocol stack is also examined. To construct the automatic collecting data mechanism, we consider a cluster based wireless sensor network (WSN) where routers and a GPRS gateway are used to link each cluster to a data collection center. Advantages of this proposed configuration are the simple implementation, low cost and low power consumption. By using the Monte Carlo simulation technique, packet delivery ratio and power consumption for different topologies are investigated.

In this paper, we propose a complete method to reconstruct an elevation surface from 3D point clouds. The method consists of three steps. In the first step, we triangulate an elevation surface of 3D point cloud structured in a 3D grid. In the second step, we remove the outward triangles to deal with concave regions on the boundary of the triangular mesh. In the third step, we reconstruct this surface by filling the hole of triangular mesh. Our method could process very fast for triangulating the surface, preserve the topology and characteristic of the input surface after reconstruction.</td><td>surface reconstruction; 3d point cloud; delaunay triangulation; voxel traversal search; hole ﬁlling</td><td>[1] M.

Factorization can provide a means for interpretation and compression of the spectral data. Hyperspectral images are represented as non-negative matrices by graphic concatenation, with the pixels arranged into columns and each row corresponding to a spectral band. SVD and principal component analysis enjoy a broad range of applications, including, rank estimation, noise reduction, classification and compression, with the resulting singular vectors forming orthogonal basis sets for subspace projection techniques. A key property of non-negative matrices is that their columns/rows form non-negative cones, with any non-negative linear combination of the columns/rows belonging to the cone. Data sets of spectral images and time series reside in non-negative orthants and while subspaces spanned by SVD include all orthants, SVD projections can be constrained to the non-negative orthants. In this paper we utilize constraint sets that confine projections of SVD singular vectors to lie within the cones formed by the spectral data. The extreme vectors of the cone are found and these vectors form a basis for the factorization of the data. The approach is illustrated in an application to hyperspectral data of a mining area collected by an airborne sensor.</td><td>svd; non-negative factorization; convex cones; linear homogeneous inequalities; spectral images</td><td>[1] N.

We utilize Brownian motion (BM) processes to model targeted and non-targeted dynamics of the MS. The proposed trajectory model consists of both drift and random components to capture both targeted and non-targeted motions of the MS. The Brownian trajectory model is then employed to provide a non-stationary channel model, in which the scattering effects of the propagation area are modelled by a non-centred one-ring geometric scattering model. The starting point of the motion is a fixed point in the propagation environment, whereas its terminating point is a random point along a predetermined drift. The drift component can be controlled by a so-called drift parameter. Tracking the MS on the proposed Brownian path allows us to derive the local angles-of-arrival (AOAs) and local angles-of-motion (AOMs), which are expressed by stochastic processes rather than random variables. We compute the first-order densities of the AOA and AOM processes in closed form. The local power spectral density (PSD) of the Doppler frequencies and the autocorrelation function (ACF) of the complex channel gain are also provided. Given a walking speed scenario, the analytical results are demonstrated and explained in depth. It turns out that the proposed Brownian path model results in a non-stationary non-isotropic channel model. The proposed geometry-based channel model is very useful for the performance analysis of mobile communication systems under non-stationary conditions.</td><td>brownian motion processes; non-stationary channels; targeted motions; non-targeted motions; non-centred onering scattering model</td><td>[1] J.

This method utilizes a bank of Phase Locked Loops (PLLs) to calculate the differential phase of signal received by an M-element uniform circular antenna array with a commutative switch followed by single channel Software Defined Radio (SDR) receiver. One important factor when using conventional phase locked loop is the requirement of the small convergence rate of the algorithm compared to the switching cycle. In order to achieve small convergence rate, we propose a method for DOA estimation with low computation complexity that improves significantly the performance of conventional PLLs system. An analysis of the challenges of computation complexity in this algorithm is presented. The simulation results for DOA estimation using the proposed structure with low complexity are shown to verify the performance of the system.</td><td>– direction finding (df); direction of arrival (doa); software deﬁned radio (sdr); digital pll</td><td>[1] R.

Every scrambled binary watermark bit is embedded into each block based on the difference value of two largest coefficients. The watermark is recovered by comparing the difference values in each block to an adaptive threshold. The accuracy of an extracted watermark depends on the threshold which is determined by minimizing the sum of weighted within-class variance. The performance of the proposed watermarking method is represented through experimental results under various types of attack such as, Histogram Equalization, Cropping, Low-pass Filtering, Gaussian noise, Salt & Pepper noise and JPEG compression.

For its efficiency, the H.264 is expected to encode real-time and/or high-definition video. However, the H.264 standard also requires highly complex and long lasting computation. To overcome these difficulties, many efforts have been deployed to increase encoding speed. Besides, with the revolution of portable devices, multimedia chips for mobile environments are more and more developed. Thus, power-oriented design for H.264 video encoders is currently a tremendous challenge. This paper discusses these trends and presents an overview of the state of the art on power features for different H.264 hardware encoding architectures. We also propose the VENGME’s design, a particular hardware architecture of H.264 encoder that enables applying low-power techniques and developing power-aware ability. This low power encoder is a four-stage architecture with memory access reduction, in which, each module has been optimized.

The signal power transfer and transform at the interface between the global lognormal shadowing sub-channels and the local Nakagami multipath sub-channels in the presence of correlation between these diversity sub-channels is rather complex. This is the main reason why a thorough analysis or a simulation model is absent to date for the case of correlated composite Nakagami-lognormal diversity channels. This paper presents a novel technique for the estimation of the probability density function (PDF) of the signal-to-noise (SNR) at the output of a maximum ratio combining (MRC) receiver operating in correlated composite diversity fading channels. The PDF is estimated using the recently proposed two-point lossless moment generating function (MGF) matching technique and a closed-form expression for the bit-error rate (BER) for QPSK signal is consequently presented using the Gauss-Hermite polynomial approximation. The paper also presents the complex Monte-Carlo simulation model for the MRC reception and BER counting in correlated composite Nakagami-lognormal fading channels.</td><td>– nakagami-lognorma;  maximum ratio combining (mrc); two point matching; moment generating function (mgf)</td><td>[1] L.

In particular, the destination selects the maximum output from all the outputs of the square-law detectors to perform the detection of the transmitted information. A close-form expression for the bit-error-rate (BER) is analytically derived when the system is deployed with binary frequency-shift keying (BFSK) modulation. The thresholds used at the relays to address the issue of error propagation are optimized to minimize the BER. While finding the optimal thresholds requires information on the average signal-to-noise ratios (SNRs) of all the transmission links in the system, the approximate thresholds at each relay that require only information on the average SNR of the source-corresponding relay are investigated. It is also derived that the system achieves a full diversity order with the approximate thresholds. Finally, both analytical and simulation results are provided to verify our analysis.</td><td>– cooperative diversity; frequency-shift keying; fading channel; decode-and-forward protocol; selection combining; square-law detector</td><td>[1] M.

Methods for fast MRI have been proposed, most notably among them are pMRI (parallel MRI), SWIFT (SWeep Imaging with Fourier Transformation), and compressed sensing (CS) based MRI. Although it promises to significantly reduce acquisition time, applying CS to MRI leads to difficulties with hardware design because of the randomness nature of the measurement matrix used by the conventional CS methods. In this paper, we propose a novel method that combines the above-mentioned three approaches for fast MRI by designing a compound measurement matrix from a series of single measurement matrices corresponding to pMRI, SWIFT, and CS. In our method, the CS measurement matrix is designed to be deterministic via chaotic systems. This chaotic compressed sensing (CCS) measurement matrix, while retaining most features of the random CS matrix, is simpler to realize in hardware. Several compound measurement matrices have been constructed and examined in this work, including CCS-MRI, CCS-pMRI, CCS-SWIFT, and CCS-pSWIFT. Simulation results showed that the proposed method allows an increase in the speed of the MRI acquisition process while not compromising the quality of the acquired MR images.</td><td>– magnetic resonance imaging (mri);  sweep imaging with fourier transformation (swift); parallel mri; fast acquisition; compressed sensing; measurement matrix chaotic ﬁlter; deterministic design</td><td>[1] C.

Specifically, packet transmission delay and reliability of GPSR in an IEEE 802.15.4-based wireless mesh NAN with practical system parameters are measured by simulations. The results show that, at the data rate required for conventional SG applications including smart metering, real-time pricing and demand response, the delay can always be maintained below 70 ms (in 95th-percentile perspective) while packet delivery ratio is higher than 90%. However, due to that fact that more advanced applications that require information exchange at higher rates and more stringent delays are emerging in SG, the performance of GPSR in NAN scenarios using radio technologies that can support higher loads and/or larger network scales needs to be studied.</td><td>– smart grid communication network (sgcn); neighbor area network (nan); wireless routing; greedy perimeter stateless routing (gpsr)</td><td>[1] Draft Guide for Smart Grid Interoperability of Energy Technology and Information Technology Operation With the Electric Power System (EPS), and End-Use Applications and Loads, IEEE P2030 Std., 2011.<br />[2] “Communications requirements of smart grid technologies,” US’s Department of Energy, Tech.

Authentication is necessary in multi-user systems. User name and password are used to authenticate a user. Text-based strong password scheme can provide security to a certain degree. Users tend to pick short passwords or passwords that are easy to remember, which makes the passwords vulnerable for attackers to break. Furthermore, textual password is vulnerable to shoulder-surfing, hidden camera and spy-ware attacks. Graphical authentication has been proposed as a possible alternative solution to text-based authentication, motivated particularly by the fact that humans can remember images better than text. However, they are mostly vulnerable to shoulder surfing. In this paper, we propose a Multi-level Scalable Textual-Graphical Password Authentication Scheme for web based applications. This scheme integrates both graphical and textual password schemes, and provides multi-level authentication scheme as compared to previously proposed single level scheme. In this scheme multi-level authentication is obtained by making use of SMS service, hence provides more secure service. This scheme shows significant potential bridging the gap between conventional textual password and graphical password. Further enhancements of this scheme are proposed and briefly discussed.</td><td>– multi-level authentication; multi-level security; sms based security; intrusion prevention; shape based authentication</td><td>[1] M.

The challenges come from a new trend of services called OTT (Over The Top). These OTT services provide the mobile users with flexible, convenient and more importantly free means to do their daily multimedia communication needs and seamlessly without any border so that operators couldn’t be just simply block it, but in opposite, need to find solutions to compete against it. Because of that, nowadays, more and more operators choose to deploy the standard RCS (Rich Communication Suite). RCS is a set of rich features communication services developed on top of IMS framework. Although there have been tremendous efforts to develop the architecture and protocols for IMS, which is a key technology of the NGN, it is far from being widely deployed. There are many reasons for that unpopularity (of IMS commercial deployment), namely, the lacking of clear business model for IMS-based services, no big difference between IMS-based services and SOA (Service Oriented Architecture) services, lack of the true demands for features that IMS based services have, etc... However, one of the most important reason that till now not many researchers have pointed out and addressed it, is about the OSS (Operation and Support Subsystem) functions. The lacking of OSS clearly defined functions and interfaces make the difficulties for operators and even equipment manufacturers to collect the pay back for any big scale IMS deployment for their networks. This paper presents our proven that IMS can provide the killer applications with blending features like mash-up and readily equipped with the intelligent charging and policy control functions. That may partly help to speed up the deployment process of IMS in real networking environment.</td><td>– ims, les; online charging; ofﬂine charging; ro/rf; blended services; combined services; garc; policy control</td><td>[1] R.

The main goal of matching is to group the models into different categories according to their similarity in order to allow their retrieval for recognition purposes and for further usage. So, in most of the cases, the comparison is run on a large dataset containing various models whether they belong to the same type of object or not and generally having similar or different shapes and poses. The objects’ nature and characteristics are important factors to be taken into consideration before performing the comparison step. We distinguish between two main categories of objects: rigid objects and deformable objects whose treatment and handling differ in the modeling as well as in the comparison phases. In this paper, we will be focusing on the comparison of deformable objects, and thus dealing with objects whose shapes might vary in different instances. For this purpose two main approaches used in the retrieval of 3D deformable models will be reviewed and implemented: the spectral approach and the bag-of-features approach. The deformation or variation in shape involves different aspects depending on the type of object. It could be a change in the posture of an articulated or bendable model, or it could result from a variation (loss or gain) in the total mass leading to a change in the surface and thus in the shape of the object. Even more complex situations occur when both cases are combined together.</td><td>– shape representation; shape analysis; global shape retrieval; partial matching; features extraction; bag of features; spectral embedding</td><td>[1] K.-L.

New exact and asymptotic analytic expressions under consideration of both interference power constraint and maximum transmit power constraint are derived in closed-form and are extensively corroborated by Monte-Carlo simulations. These expressions facilitate in evaluating effectively the network performance behaviour in key operation parameters as well as in optimizing system parameters. A multitude of analytical results expose that underlay relay cognitive networks experience the performance saturation phenomena while their performance considerably depends on the number of hops for the linear network model. Additionally, optimum relay position is significantly dependent of maximum transmit power, maximum interference power, and licensee location. Moreover, the appropriate order of locating unlicensees with different maximum transmit power levels can dramatically improve the network performance.</td><td>– cooperative communications; underlay cognitive radio network; rayleigh fading; bit error rate</td><td>[1] FCC, “Spectrum policy task force report,” ET Docket 02135, Nov. 2002.<br />[2] A.

Regular position based routing algorithms fail to find a route from a source to a destination in some cases when the network contains nodes with irregular transmission ranges or they find a route that is much longer than the shortest path. On the other hand routing algorithms based on Ant Colony Optimization (ACO) find routing paths that are close to the shortest paths even if the nodes in the network have different transmission ranges. The drawback of these algorithms is the large number of messages that needs to be sent or the long delay before the routes are established. In this paper, we propose a novel protocol AntNet-LA which combines the idea of ACO with information about position of all nodes. In this technique the distance between the nodes is considered to transmit the packets, hence overcomes the drawbacks of AntNet algorithm which considers only cumulative probability for packet transmission. We compare performance of AntNet-LA with AntNet, Ad-hoc On Demand Distance Vector (AODV), Ad-hoc On Demand Multipath Distance Vector (AOMDV), Dynamic Source Routing (DSR) and Destination-Sequenced Distance-Vector Routing (DSDV) protocols. We also compare performance of AntNet-LA with distance-aware protocols such as Location Aided Routing (LAR), Geographical AODV GeoAODV and Position Based ANT colony optimization (PBANT).</td><td>– ant colony optimization; modiﬁed antnet; antnet-la; location aware protocol</td><td>[1] G.

To enhance the synchronization between stations, we propose to extract known information by both the transmitter and the receiver at the IEEE 802.11a physical layer to be then exploited by the receiver in addition to the training sequences. Indeed the parts of the identified SIGNAL field are either known or predictable from the RtS (Request to Send) control frame when the CSMA/CA (Carrier Sense Multiple Access with Collision Avoidance) mechanism is triggered jointly to bit-rate adaptation algorithms to the channel. Moreover the received RtS control frame allows the receiver to estimate the channel before time synchronization stage improving then the performance of the proposed synchronization algorithm. Simulation results show that the performance of the proposed synchronization algorithm is improved as compared to existing algorithms.</td><td>– ieee 802.11a; ofdm, signal ﬁeld; channel estimation; time synchronization; frequency synchronization; rts control frame; csma/ca.</td><td>[1] IEEE Std.802.11a, Std., 1999.<br />[2] T.

However, the depth data captured by Kinect over a certain distance is of low quality. In this work, we implement a set of algorithms allowing users to capture 3D surfaces by using the handheld Kinect. As a classic alignment algorithm such as the Iterative Closest Point (ICP) does not show efficacy in aligning point clouds that have limited overlapped regions, another coarse alignment using the Sample Consensus Initial Alignment (SAC-IA) is incorporated in to the registration process in order to ameliorate 3D point clouds’ fitness. Two robust reconstruction methods namely the Alpha Shapes and the Grid Projection are also implemented to reconstruct 3D surface from registered point clouds. The experimental results have shown the efficiency and applicability of of our blueprint. The constructed system obtains acceptable results in a few minutes with a low price device, thus it may practically be an useful approach for avatar generations or online shoppings.</td><td>Kinect camera;  3D-image reconstruction;  sample consensus initial alignment;  point clouds; alpha shapes; grid projection.</td><td>[1] R.

To this end, this paper investigates the impact of different kinds of jamming on the performance of MIMO STBC systems. Closed form expressions for the bit error probability (BEP) of the performance of binary phase shift keying (BPSK) STBC communication system over Rayleigh fading channel under the impact of both partial band and broad-band jamming for different number of transmitting and receiving antennas are presented. Computer simulations are provided to validate the theoretical developments. It has been found that the performance of such systems is severely deteriorated in the presence of strong jamming power (with a signal to jamming power ratio less than − 10dB) and the worst scenario occurs in the presence of broad-band jamming.</td><td></td><td>[1] A.

One solution to this problem is to intelligently control the power consumption of switches used in data centers. This paper proposes an extension to OpenFlow switches to support different power saving modes. The extension includes defining new messages in the OpenFlow protocol stack and designing an OpenFlow Switch Controller (OSC) that is able to turn on/off switches and disable/enable ports. To prove the soundness of the proposed extension, the functions of an OSC has been integrated in a NetFPGA based OpenFlow switch used in the ECODANE framework.

The approach exploits sampling phase diversity provided by the cyclostationary nature of the received signals as an advantageous means of constructing multiple sets of distinct autocorrelation matrices evaluated at equals time lags. Channel estimation is then performed via joint diagonalization of a set of differential autocorrelation target matrices, avoiding the need of noise power or statistical distribution estimation. A broad set of simulation experiments is presented in distinctive signal contexts as a means of supporting and evidencing the potential of the proposed estimation method.</td><td>– array processing; signal model; blind identiﬁcation; blind source separation; joint diagonalization; approximate joint diagonalization; cyclostationarity; synchronous signals; asynchronous signals</td><td>[1] A.

Therefore dissemination with efficient broadcast is an essential communication primitive. One of the families of broadcast protocols suitable for such networks, is the family of delay-based broadcast protocols, where farthest receivers retransmit first and where transmissions also act as implicit acknowledgements. For lossless networks, such protocols may approach the optimum efficiency. However with realistic loss models of VANET wireless communication, their performance is noticeably degraded. This is because packet losses have a double effect: directly on the amount of successfully received packets and indirectly with implicit acknowledgement misses. In this article, in order to combat the effects of packet losses, we combine delay-based broadcast with network coding, through a new protocol: Delay-based Opportunistic Network Coding protocol (DONC). By design, DONC aims at cancelling the twofold effects of packet and implicit acknowledgement losses. We describe the details of the DONC protocol, and we study its behavior, with realistic models and simulations. Results illustrate the excellent performance of the protocol.</td><td>wireless networks; broadcast; network coding; vanet (vehicular ad hoc network)</td><td>[1] S. Panichpapiboon and W.

As they are more important in human life, their correctness should be considered carefully. Although there are some EDA tools for design and synthesis of asynchronous circuits, they are lack of methods for verifying the correctness of the produced circuits. In this work, we are about to propose a verification method and apply it in making a new version of the PAiD tool that can enable engineers to design, synthesize and verify asynchronous circuits.

The traveling salesman problem (TSP) is the benchmark used for testing new combinatoric optimization algorithms. This paper revisits the application of ACO techniques to the TSP and discuss some general aspects of ACO that have been previously overlooked. In fact, it is observed that the solution length does not reflect exactly the quality of a particular edge belong to the solution, but it is only used for relatively evaluating whether the edge is good or bad in the process of reinforcement learning. Based on this observation, we propose two algorithms– Smoothed Max-Min Ant System and Three-Level Ant System– which not only can be easily implemented but also provide better performance, as compared to the well-known Max-Min Ant System. The performance is evaluated by numerical simulation using benchmark datasets.</td><td>ant colony optimization;traveling salesman problem;pheromone update rule;reinforcement learning;random walk</td><td>[1] M.

This model is able to simultaneously take into account all effects of atmospheric turbulence including attenuation, intensity fluctuation, and pulse broadening, which has not been considered in previous works. In addition, the impacts of APD shot noise, background noise, and thermal noise are included in our analysis. The numerical results show that the main factor that limits the system performance is intensity fluctuation. However, when M is large enough, optical pulse is so short that the effect of pulse broadening becomes dominant. By using APD receiver, bit-error rate is improved significantly. Finally, based on channel capacity, we are able to determine the maximum transmission length of the system.</td><td>– free-space optical communications (fso); pulse-position modulation (ppm); avalanche photodiode (apd); atmospheric turbulence</td><td>[1] H.

It consists of a linear null-space precoder used by the secondary transmitter to effectively cancel the interference towards one or more primary receivers, while guaranteeing a non-negligible rate to a served secondary receiver. In this work, we propose an implementation of an experimental test-bed using the new SDR4All platform developed at the Alcatel-Lucent Chair on Flexible Radio (SUPELEC) to take a step towards a proof of concept of a VFDM-based system. We focus on the secondary link, where an opportunistic transmitter/receiver pair communicates over moderately frequency selective channels, characterized by very short root mean square (r.m.s.) delay spreads and non uniform power delay profiles (PDP). The obtained results show the practical feasibility of a VFDM transmission over a secondary link. However, a significant bit error rate (BER) loss with respect to the previously shown achievable theoretical performance is evident. A thorough analysis of the structure of the VFDM precoder is carried out and the impact of the channel characteristics on the performance of the opportunistic system is discussed. Numerical findings demonstrate that the potential BER drop can be addressed by designing a suitable flexible receiver able to deal with the effect induced by non uniform PDP and short r.m.s. delay spread channels.</td><td>– cognitive overlay network; interference cancellation; small-cells; vfdm</td><td>[1] L.

The proposed method aims to fit the time-frequency correlation function (TFCF) of the simulation model to that of a measured channel. The parameters of the simulation model are determined iteratively by minimizing the Frobenius norm, which serves as a measure for the fitting error. In contrast to the original INLSA method, the proposed approach provides a unique optimized set of model parameters, which guarantees a quasi-perfect fitting with respect to the TFCF. We analyze the performance of the proposed method in terms of the goodness of fit to the measured data. The investigations will be carried out with respect to the TFCF and the scattering function. We demonstrate that the proposed approach is a powerful tool for the design of measurement-based wideband channel simulators, which are important for the performance evaluation of mobile communication systems under real-world propagation conditions.</td><td>– mobile fading channels; measurement-based channel models; channel simulators; single-input single-output; time-frequency correlation function; iterative parametrization</td><td>[1] H.

In this paper, the performance of secrecy, offered by multihop decode-and-forward relaying, is investigated and compared to its counterpart in direct transmission. Three key performance measures are derived over Rayleigh fading channels: probability of non-zero secrecy capacity, secure outage probability and secrecy capacity, which are valid for an arbitrary number of hops. Based on the tractable form of the probability of non-zero secrecy capacity, the optimization problem of trusty relay replacement is also studied. Numerical results indicate that a proper relay replacement can increase the network security without extra network resources. The correctness of analytical results is confirmed by using a MATLAB-based independent simulation model.</td><td>– secrecy capacity; decode-and-forward; multihop networks; probability of non-zero secrecy capacity; secure outage probability</td><td>[1] J.

We further compare the minimum length and the error performance of the column-weight-three codes constructed by the proposed algorithm and those found by the conventional greedy construction algorithm.

There are basically two approaches to resample the signals. Both approaches are thoroughly described and practical circuits for hardware implementation are provided. A comparison of the two circuits presented in the paper shows that one circuit requires a division to compute the new sampling times. This time scaling operation adds complexity to the implementation with no performance advantage over the other circuit, and makes the “division free” circuit the preferred one for resampling.</td><td>asynchronous resampling;sampling rate conversion;cable modem;interpolation;phase locked loop</td><td>[1]L.

All antenna elements or sensors being used to collect data are sampled at the same time. By doing so, the size of the antenna array is proportional to the area of interest in space. The antenna array is prohibitively huge if the area that we want to cover is large. In this paper, in order to reduce the number of antenna elements in use, we propose a novel multi-dimensional spectrum estimation technique based on displacing small antenna arrays along predefined paths. It includes a data measurement technique which sequentially collects data samples within each snapshot in space according to a predefined order, and a spectral estimation technique which is based on the Discrete Fourier Transform (DFT) of the collected data. The key idea is to create a large synthetic antenna aperture by displacing a small antenna array along a predefined trajectory. Impinging waves are assumed uniform plane waves. The performance of the proposed technique is evaluated by simulation. The applications of the proposed technique include synthetic aperture radar, radar image processing and sonar systems.</td><td>multi-dimensional spectral estimation;spatial sampling;wave vector spectrum estimation;uniform plan wave propagation</td><td>[1]J.

Delay and delay variation characteristics of IP packets transferred over multi-section networks can be derived, estimated or composed from component distributions of IP package delay in each network section. Approximate methods are needed in the cases of unknown or complicated delay distribution functions, which are unavailable or unusable in practice. The ITU-T has proposed a method for estimating IP packet delay variation. One of noticeable factors affecting the estimation accuracy is the packet delay population quantile which has not been adequately considered. The objective of this paper is to examine the optimal range of quantiles used for estimating the IP packet delay variation in the NGN (Next Generation Network) core networks. The paper is composed from the following ideas. Firstly, several concepts and mathematical formulas related to delay metrics based on probability and statistics theory are defined. The approximate method of ITU-T for estimating the IP packet delay variation in a multi-section network is revised. Then, another method based on convolution for composing the empirical IPTD distribution functions is proposed for the same target as the first one. Secondly, a number of test cases are implemented to measure the IP packet delay on several sections of an NGN core network. Sample data are used for computing and estimating the IP packet delay variation for multi-section networks by two methods with certain hypotheses. Finally, these methods are compared and evaluated both theoretically and empirically in regards to the estimation accuracy versus quantiles of the IP packet transfer delay. The best range of quantiles is determined to ensure the accuracy of the estimation method applied for the NGN core network.</td><td>delay distribution;delay variation;quantile;multi-section network;ngn core network</td><td>[1]ITU, “Internet protocol data communication service - IP packet transfer and availability performance parameters,” ITU-T Recommendation Y.1540, Feb. 1999.<br />[2]——, “Network performance objectives for IP-based services,” ITU-T Recommendation Y.1541, 2006.<br />[3]A.

Especially, CPPM provides better performance than other chaotic modulation methods in noise- and distortion-affected environments. In this paper we present our development of a robust method named M-ary CPPM which is based on the combination of the conventional CPPM and multi-symbol modulation in order to improve the transmission bit rate. The M-ary CPPM signal has a pulse train format in which each pulse is a symbol and the chaotically-varied inter-pulse time interval conveys the binary information of k bits (M = 2k). The analysis and development of modulation and demodulation schemes are presented in detail. Theoretical evaluation of Bit-Error-Rate (BER) performance in the presence of additive white Gaussian noise (AWGN) and the use of AWGN filtering is also provided. The chaotic behavior of the M-ary CPPM is investigated with the variation of modulation parameters. In order to verify the performance of the proposed schemes, numerical simulations were carried out in Simulink and comparison between simulation and theoretical results is reported.</td><td>chaotic modulation;chaotic pulse position modulation;cppm;m-ary modulation;chaos-based digital communication;ultra-wide band;tent map</td><td>[1] S.

Based on the correlation model, we design a simulation model using the sum-of-sinusoids (SOS) method to enable the simulation of spatial lognormal processes characterizing real-world shadow fading scenarios. The model parameters of the simulation model are computed by applying the Lp-norm method (LPNM). This method facilitates an excellent fitting of the simulation model’s autocorrelation function (ACF) to that of measured channels. Our study includes an evaluation of all important statistical quantities of the proposed measurement-based simulation model, such as the probability density function (PDF), spatial ACF, decorrelation and coherence distance, as well as the level-crossing rate (LCR) and the average duration of fades (ADF). A comparison with the Gudmundson correlation model shows that the developed measurement-based correlation model outperforms the former one by far in terms of the goodness of fit to the measured data. The proposed measurement-based simulation model allows to study the effects of long-term fading on the performance of mobile communication systems under real-world shadow fading conditions.</td><td>Shadow fading;lognormal process;sum-of-sinusoids;autocorrelation function;level-crossing rate;average duration of fades.</td><td>[1]Y.

However, one weakness of LRA detector is that the quantization step in LRA detector is not optimal. Based on simulation results, we show that most of detection errors in LRA linear detectors are due to quantization errors. We then propose two methods to correct the quantization errors. In the first method, sphere detectors are introduced to correct quantization errors at low additional complexity. As a second approach, we propose a list quantization scheme which can generate a list of candidate symbols from the original LRA estimated symbols. From these listed symbols, decisions are made according to the minimum Euclidean distance between the received and estimated points. It is shown by simulations that both methods provide significant BER performance improvements with only a small additional complexity.</td><td>zf, mmse;lattice reduction;mimo;spatial multiplexing;quantization error;sphere detection.</td><td>[1]I.

It is assumed that the spreading waveforms are not orthogonal and hence, Multiple Access Interference (MAI) exists at the relay nodes as well as the BS. MAI degrades the signal quality at both relays and BS and decreases the cooperative diversity gain. To alleviate this problem, an Ant Colony Optimization (ACO) based Multi-User Detector (MUD) has been proposed to efficiently combine the received signals from the direct and relay paths and sub-optimally extract transmitted bits at the BS. The computational complexity of proposed algorithm is significantly lower than that of the Maximum Likelihood (ML) detector. More explicitly, for a cooperative network supporting 15 users, the computational complexity of the proposed ACO algorithm is a factor of 103 lower than that of the optimum Bayesian detector. Simulation results show that the performance of the proposed ACO-based detector can closely approach the maximum diversity in terms of BER and efficiently cancel the MAI at the BS.</td><td>cooperative diversity;ds-cdma systems;multiuser detection;ant colony optimization.</td><td>[1]A.

However, this standard comes with an extraordinary computational complexity and a huge memory access requirement, which make the hardware architecture design much more difficult and costly, especially for realtime applications. In the framework of H.264 codec hardware architecture project, this paper presents an efficient architecture of Forward Transform and Quantization (FTQ) for H.264/AVC codecs in mobile applications. To reduce the hardware implementation overhead, the proposed design uses only one unified architecture of 1-D transform engine to perform all required transform processes, including discrete cosine transform and Walsh Hadamard transform. This design also enables to share the common parts among multipliers that have the same multiplicands. The performance of the design is taken into consideration and improved by using a fast architecture of the multiplier in the quantizer, the most critical component in the design. Experimental results show that our architecture can completely finish transform and quantization processes for a 4:2:0 macroblock in 228 clock cycles and the achieved throughput is 445Msamples/s at 250MHz operating frequency while the area overhead is very small, 147755μm2 (approximate 15KGates), with the 130nm TSMC CMOS technology.</td><td>iso/iec 14496-10 avc;itu-t recommendation h.264;vlsi architecture for h.264 codec;forward transforms and quantization;integer dct;quantization.</td><td>[1] “ITU-T recommendation and international standard of joint video speciﬁcation,” ITU-T Rec.

The design depends mainly on the mobility pattern as in highly mobile environments, intelligence at the terminal reduces the cost of signaling whereas for fixedling whereas for fixed (non-mobile) networks, all the intelligence can be put on the network side.

While many examples, both natural and artificial, can be found of such self-organized systems, the relationship between the local rules and the global behavior remains elusive and no systematic procedure is known to engineer a specific global result. Given the increasing pervasiveness of wireless networks of all sorts, including ad hoc networks competing within narrow unlicensed bands and wireless sensor networks, self-organization could constitute the next defining paradigm in wireless communications. It can be shown that a set of heuristic principles can be leveraged to engineer a self-organized connection-oriented wireless network with minimal complexity. Such a system requires no centralization of information, yet achieves a nearly optimal global state with only a modest amount of local signaling. It will naturally and jointly balance the many parameters related to radio resource management, exhibiting great adaptability, fault tolerance and scalability.</td><td>multi-agents;distributed base stations;emergent behavior;channel allocation;channel segregation;interference</td><td>[1] H.

A physical layer able to operate efficiently in an unsynchronized environment is needed and it is shown that the filter bank multicarrier (FBMC) technique can meet the objectives in terms of performance and flexibility. Then, a protocol must be developed to ensure global convergence and an overall transmission capacity close to the optimal possible value at a given place and a given time. An approach called “good neighbour” is presented, which consists of building the capacity requested by the users through a threshold regulated local search and with minimum changes in frequency band allocation to reduce interference non-stationarity to other systems. Finally, potential applications of opportunistic networks are reviewed and the conditions for proliferation of this kind of network are discussed.</td><td></td><td>[1] ITU-R, Annex 19 to document 5A/513, “Cognitive radio systems in the land mobile service,” International Telecommunication Union (ITU), Tech.

The Doppler frequency is dependent on the carrier frequency and channel variation rate. In a fixed wireless channel, the channel variations are caused by scatterer motion. In this paper, we investigate analytically the Doppler effects generated by scatterer motion under different scatterer velocity distributions using the ring-of-scatterers geometric model. The proposed model considers Doppler frequency components caused by scatterer mobility to both received and reflected signals at each scatterer, and therefore is called the double Doppler model. The analytical curves are compared and statistically tested with several measurement results published in the literature. At low scatterer speeds, e.g., generated by moving foliage, the exponential velocity distribution is an appropriate model to describe the time-varying nature of the fixed wireless channels. The curve fitting results also show that our analytical model better approaches the empirical curves than the single Doppler model does. However, further investigation is still needed to find a suitable scatterer velocity distribution that closely describes the double Doppler effect in fast-variation fixed wireless channels, e.g., caused by passing vehicles.</td><td>double doppler effect;doppler power spectrum;scatterer motion;scatterer velocity distribution.</td><td>[1]W.

Based on the pair-wise error probability (PEP) analysis, an optimal class of 2 × 2 precoders is first derived for the traditional power allocation scheme, where one-third of the system power is spent at the relay node, while two-thirds are spent at the source node. Different from optimal unitary precoders proposed earlier, the derived class of precoders indicates that the source should spend all its power transmitting a superposition of the symbols in the broadcast phase, while being silent in the cooperative phase, for optimal asymptotic performance. We then further address the problem of jointly optimal precoder and power allocation for the system under consideration. It is shown that the total power should be equally distributed to the source and the relay, and the source should again spend no power during the cooperative phase for the best asymptotic performance. Analytical and simulation results reveal that the proposed precoders not only exploit full cooperative diversity, but also provide significant coding gain over the optimal unitary precoders. For instance, a coding gain of around 1dB can be attained at the practical BER level of 10 − 5 for various modulation schemes.</td><td>amplify-and-forward;relay channel;error performance;precoder;power allocation</td><td>[1]A.

Our main contributions are two-fold. First, we introduce a new approach to compute the network load metric based on the radio link quality and scheduling information, which can be applied to any wireless packet system. This load metric hides the radio resources heterogeneity of different access technologies from the load balancer. Secondly, we propose a new practical load balancing algorithm which provides a more efficient way to manage the scarce radio resources. The proposed approach has been compared with different existing schemes and the results show the superiority of the proposed solution.</td><td>load balancing;heterogeneous networks;handover;radio resource management;utility</td><td>[1]S.-L.

Validation of new communication protocols for these networks requires exhaustive simulation runs because real life experiences can be performed exclusively during expensive civil protection exercises. The necessity of these simulations calls for realistic and reliable mobility models which take into account numerous aspects of rescue worker interventions. We propose a composite model of mobility for disaster scenarii which includes a realistic model of human displacement, team mobility, and obstacle avoidance. The comparison of its performance with those of other available models is encouraging. We believe that it can improve the veracity of rescue operation simulations.</td><td>ad hoc network;mobility model</td><td>[1] S. Kurkowski, T. Camp, and M.
